Materials for Sustainable Development PhD Spring 2024 Causal Inference Workshop 

Based on Claire Palandri's 2022 [version](https://clairepalandri.github.io/docs/CIworkshop_syllabus.pdf) of the workshop

## Outline
- Week 1: Modeling assumptions
- Week 2: Potential outcomes framework (and DAGs, briefly)

## Coding examples and exercises 
- Week 1: What happens when errors are spatially correlated? Simulated exercise

## Other helpful resources for causal inference and research design 
- [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/) by Scott Cunningham (contains helpful coding examples in Stata, R, and Python)
- [The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality](https://theeffectbook.net/index.html) by Nick Huntington-Klein
