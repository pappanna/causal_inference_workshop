Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jonathan. I will be your conference facilitator today.
Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listenonly mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be
given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron
Corporation. Mr. Mike Wirth, please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

All right. Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome back. We missed you. I'd like to welcome everybody to Chevron's
first quarter earnings call and webcast. Our new CFO, Pierre Breber, and our Head of Investor Relations, Wayne
Borduin, are on the call with me. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement and the important information for investors
and stockholders on slide 2.
Moving to slide 3. Today, I'll make a few opening comments. Pierre will review the first quarter results and then
we'll take your questions. As I've said before, we're well-positioned to win in any environment. During our Security
Analyst Meeting, we shared that our advantaged portfolio, strong balance sheet and low breakeven, capital
discipline, and lower execution risk position us well to deliver superior shareholder returns.
With the announced acquisition of Anadarko, our story gets even better. It builds strength on strength. We
submitted our antitrust filing yesterday to begin regulatory approvals and we've begun joint integration planning.
We know how to integrate two strong companies to create an even stronger one. We've done it well on prior
transactions and we'll do it again. We remain confident that the transaction agreed by Chevron and Anadarko will
be completed.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre who'll take you through the financial results. Pierre?

Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide 4. Our disciplined returns-focused approach to the business continues to drive
solid earnings and cash flow. First quarter earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.39 per diluted share. Excluding foreign
exchange losses, earnings were $2.8 billion or $1.47 per share.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $5.1 billion. Excluding working capital changes, it was $6.3 billion.
We maintained a strong balance sheet with a debt ratio less than 20% at quarter end.
During the first quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend to $1.19 per share, up 6%. Share repurchases during
the quarter were around $500 million, lower than our $1 billion-per-quarter guidance. During the quarter, we were
restricted from buying back shares in light of the Anadarko acquisition.

Turning to slide 5. Despite lower refining and chemical margins, cash flow was solid and the trend is in line with
full-year guidance. Working capital effects in the quarter consumed $1.2 billion, generally consistent with our
seasonal pattern.
Free cash flow excluding working capital changes was over $3 billion. Other cash flow items included pension
contributions of about $325 million, asset sale proceeds of around $300 million, and TCO co-lending of $350
million.
We continue to make progress high grading our portfolio. Total asset sale proceeds since the beginning of 2018
are $2.3 billion, and we remain on track to reach the low end of our current three-year $5 billion to $10 billion
guidance range by the end of this year.
Slide 6 compares first quarter 2019 earnings with first quarter 2018. Earnings declined from a year ago, largely
due to lower crude oil prices and weaker downstream and chemicals margins. Special items increased earnings
by $120 million due to the absence of a first quarter 2018 asset impairment. A swing in foreign exchange impact
decreased earnings by $266 million.
Excluding special items and FX, Upstream earnings were relatively flat as higher production was offset by lower
realizations. Downstream earnings decreased by about $500 million, mostly due to weaker refining and chemicals
margins, coupled with unfavorable timing effects. The variance in the Other segment was primarily the result of
higher corporate charges.
Turning to slide 7. This compares results for first quarter 2019 with fourth quarter 2018. First quarter earnings
were about $1 billion lower than the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange impact decreased earnings by $405 million
between periods. This was partially offset by the absence of a project write-off.
Excluding special items and FX, Upstream results were flat between quarters. Lower realizations and liftings were
offset by lower depreciation and operating expenses. Downstream earnings decreased by about $600 million,
primarily due to unfavorable timing effects coupled with lower refining and marketing margins. These impacts
were partly offset by lower turnaround activity this quarter. The variance in the Other segment largely reflects an
unfavorable swing in corporate tax items.
On slide 8, first quarter 2019 oil equivalent production increased 186,000 barrels a day or almost 7% from first
quarter 2018. Production exceeded three million barrels per day for the second straight quarter.
Shale and tight production increased 143,000 barrels per day. First quarter unconventional production in the
Permian was 391,000 barrels per day, in line with our guidance and up 55%.
Production for major capital projects increased by 128,000 barrels per day, primarily due to Wheatstone, Hebron
and Bigfoot. Base declines were 30,000 barrels per day net of production from new wells notably in the Gulf of
Mexico. The effects of unplanned downtime, primarily at Gorgon, reduced production by 29,000 barrels per day.
Now, looking ahead. In Upstream, we continue to expect 2019 production growth to be 4% to 7% excluding 2019
asset sales. We closed on the sale of our Denmark assets earlier this month and are evaluating bids on our U.K.
North Sea assets. Our full-year guidance for TCO co-lending is unchanged at $2 billion dependent upon price,
investment profile and dividends.

In Downstream, we expect to close on the purchase of the Pasadena refinery in the second quarter. We also
expect high refinery turnaround activity, which equates to an estimated after-tax earnings impact of more than
$200 million.
For the second quarter, we expect restrictions on share repurchases to continue in light of the Anadarko
acquisition. Post closing, we expect to buy back shares at a rate of $1.25 billion per quarter. In the second
quarter, we expect a pension contribution around $400 million, and our full-year guidance for the Other segment
is unchanged at $2.4 billion.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a
full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one followup. We'll do our best to get all of your
questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from
Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.

Devin J. McDermott
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

So, I wanted to start because I'm sure it will be asked if I don't. Just on the Anadarko deal and the process there, I
appreciate the additional color in your prepared remarks. First, can you just walk through â€“ remind us what the
timeline is in key milestones and process from here? And any comments you could make on the competing offer
from OXY would be helpful as well? I'll leave it to you to answer that how'd you like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. So, the timeline is probably a little different today than I would have told you a couple of weeks ago because
we now have Anadarko's Board back considering an unsolicited proposal. We've made our Hart-Scott-Rodino
filing. I mentioned that that went in yesterday. We don't see any material antitrust or anticompetitive issues that
arise from the combination and so we would expect that to be handled within a pretty reasonable period of time,
say 30 to 60 days, depends if they come back for a second review with any questions.

And then, we have an Anadarko shareholder vote that will be scheduled and could result in a third quarter close. I
think we've already said second half of this year, and so that would be the timeline. I think we're going to wait and
see what â€“ the Anadarko Board has said they're reviewing this unsolicited offer. And so, we'll â€“ that obviously will
have some bearing on the overall timeline.

Devin J. McDermott

Q

Yeah, one followup. Just wanted to shift over to TCO and the co-lending. You mentioned the guidance there is
unchanged, but any color you can give us on the shaping and how we should think about that playing out
throughout the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Devin. This is Pierre. I mean, you should view it as roughly ratable and â€“ but again, it will vary depending
on prices and project spending and affiliate dividends. But if you think of it being roughly ratable during the course
of the year, that's appropriate at this point in time.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question,
please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil M. Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Hey. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Hey, Phil.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil M. Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

First question. In light of the competing bid that's put out there and the details behind that, I think one thing that
surprised investors would be perhaps the degree of synergies that OXY talked about in their proposed transaction
even if you back out the capital reduction component. And so, I think you've been asked about the degree of
conservatism already to some degree about your synergy forecast, but now that that's out there, I was just
wondering if maybe you'd have a comment about your numbers and where upside could come from.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure, Phil. So, look, I'm not going to comment on the details of another offer. I'll tell you our synergies are real and
we're confident in our ability to achieve the $2 billion in run rate synergies in the first year post-close and
delivering significant value from the deal.
As I mentioned earlier, we've already begun joint integration meetings with Anadarko. We had full teams from
both companies, meeting for multiple days this week already. We're committed to delivering the synergies. We've
got a strong history of successfully integrating two companies and meeting and often exceeding our synergy
targets. You can go back to Gulf. You can go to Texaco. You can go to Unocal. And so, this is something we've
done before and we're very good at it. We're very confident that we can deliver the $2 billion and as we â€“ we
know what we know at this point. And as we get more detail, we certainly will know more.
The other thing that I'll just mention is we have great confidence that we can accelerate value realization in the
Permian, which is not really reflected in the cost synergies. We've indicated that we can see increased capital
spending and increased activity in the Permian. We've got a strong contiguous position that results from this
transaction. We've got a royalty position that we can accelerate value from and we will absolutely be able to
deliver strong performance out of there.
We benchmark very aggressively in the Permian on a virtually continuous basis. We benchmark well
performance, well design, completion design, execution performance, cycle time, service facility's efficiency,
OpEx, unit cost realization, all the financial metrics and do that on a regular basis. And we have a strong
performing Permian business that will bring realizations and value forward that is not in that $2 billion. And so, I
think you can feel very confident that we will deliver. And as we see more value there, we will be talking to you
about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil M. Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Okay, fair enough. Just a follow-up question would be, obviously, there's more to an acquisition than just the price
offered. And I was hoping maybe you could help us think through why your lower priced offer should win from
your perspective. And if Anadarko's Board is forced to go back and quantitatively decide that this is â€“ your offer is
not good enough â€“ is there a point at which that you look at this and not consider raising a bid because this return
is destructive to you to do so?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Sure. I won't speak for the Anadarko Board. But even with the information that was made public this week, our
offer was viewed by Anadarko as superior and we have a signed merger agreements, approved unanimously by
the boards of both companies. We strongly believe the combination of our two companies create superior longterm value for shareholders of the combined company. The industrial logic of our transaction is very compelling.
Anadarko's assets further strengthen already leading positions that we have in large and attractive shale
deepwater and natural gas basins. It enables further portfolio high grading and cost reductions and focused
investment in an even stronger company.
Our financial position and balance sheet strength enables us to take on the leverage and issue the additional
equity and still continue to increase shareholder distributions. Our company simply have the best strategic fit. We
can operate in the Gulf of Mexico in ways that others cannot. We're a world-class operator of LNG. We've got
leading performance in many different dimensions in the Permian and that strong balance sheet mitigates risk.
We will be able to leverage coming out of the deal. We'll be financially strong with accretive cash flow and
earnings and full-on certain value. There's no shareholder vote required to approve the transaction. There's
strong upside in what is already a very strong currency in Chevron's stock. So, I think there are a whole host of
reasons why we have a very compelling transaction.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your question,
please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC

Q

Hi, everyone. Good afternoon from London. Mike, when we think about the potential for you to bid higher, we look
at your balance sheet and, obviously, there's a tremendous amount of firepower there, but we suspect it's not how
you would be looking at potentially adding to your bid. Can you talk about the metrics that you're looking at in
terms of Anadarko value to Chevron? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. And I want to close off, Phil actually asked a question that I failed to get to at the end of that last answer,
which kind of ties to this. And Phil, yes, there is â€“ we've been very disciplined as we've approached this, as we've
looked at valuation. And I think you said is there a point at which you're done. And of course, the answer to that is
yes, there is, and this isn't the time to address that specifically. But we've said we will do things that are value
creating for our shareholders and we don't need to do anything. We've got a very strong story without doing a
transaction.
So, Paul, to your question, we look at a whole host of metrics and some of the primary ones are the accretion
metrics. Does this give us accretive free cash flow after capital spending? Does it give us accretive earnings? Do
we get a strong return on this investment? And does it give us the investment queue, the investment set and
opportunities over time to continue to improve return on capital, which the entire industry is working to improve?
And this does give us over 10 billion barrels of resource at less than $3 a barrel, which is an attractive resource
acquisition cost. And so, there are a whole host of metrics like that that are the ones that we look at.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, and Paul I don't know if your question was getting to the mix of the equity in cash. I mean, we've talked
about the 75/25 was mutually agreed to Anadarko shareholders wanting exposure to our stock. We have a very
good stock. But clearly, we have the capacity to have alternative structures. We could have put more cash in if
that's what Anadarko wanted to do, but we agreed to where we ended up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC

Q

Yeah, I realize, Mike, that you've talked about free cash flow at some point actually accretive. Pretty much from
your point of view seems to be the single metric that we should look at. We were just wondering how to think
about...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Wayne Borduin
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

A

So, Paul, sorry, was there another follow-up question in there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC

Q

No. I think the other aspect was that you said you can't forecast; it's obviously a tough thing to measure. But it
does seem that you have a great fit. Could you talk a little bit about Mozambique and how you see that? I think
that's one of the differentiators between â€“ potentially between you and OXY? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. As I discussed on the call a couple of weeks ago, we view Mozambique as a world-class gas resource. We
are pleased with the progress that's been made. It's a very cost-competitive LNG project and that matters. We do
not intend to slow the project time line down. We think that there's a good team of people working on this and that
they've done a good job. I plan to visit Mozambique soon to see the site and visit with both government leaders
and people working on the project there.
And we think this fits well into our portfolio and with our strengths, and so we like the project. We think we can
bring some value. We've got a balance sheet to support the project. We've got experience in things like shipping
that this will have a large shipping component. So, I think there are ways we can improve and enhance execution
and value and mitigate risk in execution of the project. Thanks, Paul.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question,
please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gammel
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Thanks very much. I guess my first question is related to the â€“ your ability to operate in the Permian and the
reason I say that is the competing bidder has talked about their ability to create the most return enhancement and
their superiority as an operator. So, Mike, can you address where you think you benchmark relative to competition
in terms of Permian development right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. I mentioned earlier that we benchmark a wide range of metrics and you really need to look at performance
in its â€“ in all the dimensions. And there are ways that we've seen in the past Permian operators that will optimize
certain metrics, particularly things like early production. We don't â€“ we're very careful about choke management to
deliver the best ultimate recovery, but there are other operators that run with their chokes wide open and can
show very strong early production numbers. You look at it a year out and there's quite a different picture that you
see.
So, I think, number one, I would say you have to be very careful about which metrics you look at and we're
focused on value creation and returns. Short-term production is not the goal and we're really looking at driving
ultimately long-term recoveries, a capital-efficient model that generates leading EURs, low cost per barrel and
high returns. And you take that and you put it together with an advantaged royalty position and we can deliver
value that is difficult for anyone else to match. And over time, a company like ours has a technology capacity that
few others have and we can add even more value as we drive cost down further as we improve recoveries and
we see technology do what it always does, which is unlock greater degrees of performance. And so, I will simply
say that we look at our metrics and performance through a value lens not a production lens.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gammel
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Appreciate that, Mike. My follow-up question is at the time you announced the transaction, you did raise the target
on annual buybacks to $5 billion from what have been $4 billion. And I appreciate the run rates right now are
affected by the transaction being in a public domain. But was the $5 billion â€“ was the increase to $5 billion
contingent upon the deal completing or is that a run rate you would expect to have regardless?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

It was a announcement we made to indicate our strong confidence in the cash flow accretion and value creation
that this transaction enables, and so it is tied to the transaction. And as I said, we've got a strong case of preexisting the transaction with increase from a run rate of $3 billion last year to a run rate of $4 billion this year. And
so, the step-up to $5 billion was a signal that this deal makes us even stronger.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. And if I can just clarify on, again, the first quarter buybacks were lower, Jason, as we said. We have to stop
buying back shares. We thought it was prudent when we believe we could be â€“ we could find ourselves in
possession of material non-public information related to transaction.
So, we expect these restrictions to continue in the second quarter. Circumstances could change and we could be
able to buy back shares from time-to-time. But right now, you could expect low to no buybacks in the second
quarter. And then, again, post-closing, we intend to increase the rate to the $5 billion annual or $1.25 billion per
quarter.

Your question, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Biraj Borkhataria
Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.

Q

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had one on your exploration strategy and this also relates to Anadarko.
But we talk a lot about the Permian in terms of synergies, but it seems like there's also quite a level of upside to
exploration in the GoM if you combine the two portfolios and follow a infrastructure-led exploration strategy. Could
you just talk a little bit about that and how you're thinking about that on the basis that this transaction does close?
And then, the second question is, there was a couple of articles earlier in the year around you transferring your
Permian royalty interest into a new subsidiary. I was wondering if there's anything to that or that's just a nonnews? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. Yes. So, the first one, exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. We've talked earlier about the fact that we would
see exploration synergies as we bring the two companies together in our exploration portfolios, and we've talked
about the fact that we would have a very powerful infrastructure position in the deepwater.
When you combine that with extended-reach tiebacks, which were in the final phases of technical qualifications to
significantly extend the length of tiebacks that we can do, we can cover a lot of the Gulf of Mexico without
necessarily needing new surface infrastructure. And this allows us to begin to explore for accumulations that
might not be economic on a standalone basis to support a new greenfield project, but that could be developed
through drilling and tieback into existing infrastructures, platforms as [ph] OAG (27:42) opens up. And so, it really
enables a very different approach to exploration and I think a much higher return shorter cycle lower risk way to
look at the next phase of development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Not to say we might not have some
greenfield projects because, certainly, there could be circumstances where that becomes the right economic
outcome.
I'd also point out that we're an equity holder in a discovery that was just announced this week, the Blacktip
discovery, which Shell is the operator on, encountered over 400 feet of net pay. It's about 30 miles away from
Perdido and Whale. So, we continue to see discoveries and we've got great strengths in an area that has
tremendous resource opportunity and the challenge is to find ways to deliver it and generate better returns out of
that.
Your question on the Permian royalty, what we've done is consolidated all of our royalty into an entity, which
allows us to manage that royalty with focus and efficiency and ensure that, as activity in the Permian continues to
grow and we have a strong royalty position out of that royalty, is properly accounted for, collected and managed.
It certainly opens up options to do things that you've seen others do. I don't want to indicate that we would or
would not do that, but it certainly positions us with an entity that could enable those kinds of alternatives if at some
point we saw that as one that was desirable.

please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Good morning, team, and congrats, Pierre, again on the new role. So, the first question I had was actually on the
oil macro. Two months away from the OPEC Meeting, prices have clearly been very firm here, off bottom in 2019.
Mike, just wanted your perspective on some of the moving pieces as it relates to the oil macro. Has your view that
we're in an age of abundance fundamentally changed as you had a more conservative worldview? Or do you
think price has been artificially lifted by OPEC cuts? And how do you think about OPEC behavior from here? Not
asking you to forecast the price, but your unique position to comment given the fact that you play across the value
chain and you operate in some of these countries.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. So, let me give you my best shot on that one today, Neil. Global demand continues to be strong. We're
seeing demand go up by over 1 million barrels per day again this year. We had a very strong GDP number for the
first quarter in the U.S. I think surprisingly strong, that has come out today, and we've consistently said that we
don't see evidence of weakening around the world. We're across the value chain in many different products and
many different geographies. So, economic growth looks solid and oil demand growth continues to march upward.
At the end of last year, as we saw some weakness, there were concerns about trade and China and economic
activity, and those have somewhat receded.
On the supply side, you've got the usual set of dynamics underway, right? We've got geopolitical issues with the
Iran waivers not being extended, which creates the prospect of some tightness. Venezuela continues to be very
difficult. Libya is in and out of the news, and so you have some of the same things that create concerns and real
tightness in some cases on the supply side, and then you have OPEC plus the non-OPEC countries, which for the
last couple of years, maybe three years or so, have demonstrated the resolve to manage their supply in a way
that's consistent with more stable markets.
You throw on top of that commentary from the President, which, again today, I guess he's out with comments
about OPEC. And I think you still have OPEC in a place where they do play a role in creating a forward
expectation on the supply side. And so, in some ways, the dynamics, while the specifics of which countries might
have supply issues and how the global demand picture shapes up, it's a story of forward expectations on supply
and demand and then the geopolitical overlay that can change that.
Fundamentally, we still believe that the world needs more of all types of energy and so we're in favor of renewable
energy. We're in favor of conventional energy and economics, markets and technologies sorting out what the best
mix is in each country around the world. There is no shortage of resource to be developed and so costs matter
and we continue to drive to be very competitive from a cost and supply standpoint. So, I'm not sure I gave you
anything really brand new there, but that's how I see it.

Q

Got it. That's helpful. Just as a followup from our side is, if we were to take the Anadarko transaction out of the
equation, one of the concerns some investors have expressed over the course of the year has been, does
Chevron have the portfolio that â€“ to thrive in 2023 to 2028? And you kind of gave us some flavor of what that
looks like at the Analyst Day post the Permian ramp and post Tengiz. What's that next wedge of growth? And so,
it sort of â€“ it begs the question â€“ was the Anadarko potential transaction an offensive transaction or a defensive
transaction? So, I just want to give you an opportunity to respond to that because I think your view here is that
you do have a standalone opportunity set independent of that transaction, but it's certainly something that's been
brought up by investors.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I said it in March and I'll say it again. We do not have resource anxiety. We've been
replacing reserves. We've been nearly 70 billion barrels of resource. We've given transparency on the production
outcome for five years because people have wanted to see a longer view on that. And so you see this 3% to 4%
growth now steadily being delivered over five years, which has been difficult for companies to do consistently over
an extended period of time at the scale that our company operates. We're very confident that we can do that and
we stopped at five years just as a matter of convention, not because we think there's a problem after that. And so,
unconventionals don't flatten out after that.
Our Permian position has got decades of resource, not a few years. We tried to highlight our other shale and tight
resource positions, which are in their very early stages of development and continue to have very strong
performance metrics and economics that are converging on Permian level economics, which is really the goal that
we put in front of them. I've already talked on the call a little bit about deepwater where we've got Anchor,
Ballymore, Whale, Blacktip now. We've got the ability to bring tiebacks into a larger system or into the existing
system. Your question is ex the Anadarko transaction. We've got acreage in Brazil, in Mexico, in West Africa.
So, there are positions around the world. We've got â€“ we're still operating in Venezuela where there's an
enormous amount of resource. And one day, that will begin to be developed again. We've got production offline in
the Partitioned Zone. I'll stop there, but I'll simply say that the opportunities for us to invest in and develop a
resource that we hold today extends well beyond 2023, and it's a function of which projects compete the best for
capital investment.
A lot of short-cycle stuff in there that is pretty low risk and then there are some longer cycle things that are larger.
And I think you'll see a blend of those deliver strong economic outcomes, which is what drives our decisions not
production targets. But I think the cupboard is full, not empty.

question, please.

Blake M. Fernandez

Q

Analyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.

Thanks, guys. Good morning. Pierre, I'm sorry to flood the buybacks, but I just want to make sure I'm 100% clear
on this. Is it fair to say 2Q buybacks should essentially be zero? And assuming that is the case even when you
ramp up to $1.25 billion per quarter, obviously on a full-year basis we're going to come in below that $4 billion
number due to the Anadarko deal. Is that the correct way to look at it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, essentially and then we just restated. So, yeah, the $4 billion guidance was â€“ did not anticipate a
transaction or an acquisition at the time. There are two sort of restrictions that we're operating under. One is when
we're in possession of material non-public information, we're not allowed to buy back shares.
Even if and when that clears itself up, there are other restrictions on buybacks when there's a business
combination happening and equities being issued. So, you can't buy back during the proxy solicitation, other
limitations on buybacks versus historical rates.
So, we're just operating under a different regime here during the transaction. Post-closing, absolutely, we have
talked about the gross debt ratio being below 20%, lots of capacity to increase it. So, there could be some
buybacks, but again, the guidance is low or no buybacks in the second quarter. And then, when we get postclosing, we'll be able to give â€“ achieve the guidance and won't be encumbered by restrictions tied to the
acquisition.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Blake M. Fernandez

Q

Analyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.

Very clear. Thank you. The second question is really on the Permian and more in the gas side. I know you've
worked a lot to get firm takeaway capacity on the crude side. Waha pricing has been really weak. Can you talk
about, I guess, what alleviation avenues you have on that side as far as takeaway or improving your price
realizations as you continue to grow there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. I'll take that, Blake, and then Pierre might have some perspective as well. We've got takeaway capacity for
all our production. And so, whether it's oil, NGLs or gas, we're moving it and taking it to market. We are not
engaged in routine flaring and would not intend to flare gas to enable production, and we have shut in a little bit of
dry gas.
So, if you don't have liquids right now, sometimes it's better just keep that gas in the ground for a better market.
Our current production in the Permian is 75% liquids and 25% gas. We're focusing on liquid-rich benches. And as
we've described and you alluded to, we've been looking at takeaway capacity several quarters ahead of our
production the entire time here. And so, I think what you're seeing in the market is something that you should
expect to see for a number of years in the future, which is we got a lot of people out there that are developing
resource, get a lot of people investing in midstream infrastructure and there are going to be times when those all
sync up and you see pretty normal transportation-type differentials and you'll see other periods of time where the
market may anticipate some tightness and you'll see the differentials widen out.
I know Waha has been pretty ugly here lately. Kinder Morgan's got some pipes that come online this year and
next year, which probably start to change that equation. The Mexico market has been a little slower to come than
people expected and we've got some Waha exposure in our portfolio, but it's not anything that is material in the
scope of our company. And I think we're â€“ like I said, we're well-positioned on takeaway capacity across all the
commodities to support our production into the future.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jon Rigby
Analyst, UBS Ltd.

Q

Yeah, thanks for taking the question. It's around the CapEx side and the capital side of the transaction actually.
The first is something I don't think has got enough attention is the high grading process that will â€“ that you intend
to indulge in after the deal closes. And I just wanted to explore that because as we think about â€“ as we start to
look at the future combination â€“ we need to think about what it is you might be doing around that. So, I just
wanted to confirm whether you see that as part of the sort of value proposition that â€“ should be a value to be
delivered through that disposal process and this is a portfolio management that you can do.
Secondly is whether that process is already underway?
And thirdly, whether you can maybe lift the curtain a little and give us some idea about not necessarily the assets,
but the kind of thoughts that you have around the type of portfolio you'd like to merge with and the things that you
will be â€“ the criteria, which you'll be using.
And then, the second question if I just add it too, somewhat lengthy, is the $1 billion of CapEx efficiencies that you
identify as part of the transaction, can you just confirm that those are about doing the same thing for less rather
than just ramping down activity, so you just can't compare like-for-like? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Okay. Well, there's a lot in there, Jon. That was well done. So, let me start with the portfolio and try to frame that
up for you and then I'll come to the capital. You asked about the process. We've got an ongoing process where
we look at high grading our portfolio. We've had $2 billion, $3 billion in asset sales kind of on average over a long
period of time. We're continuing always looking to high grade the portfolio from a strategic alignment standpoint
the ability to compete for capital, what the assets are that will allow us to compete and deliver strong returns into
the future. And oftentimes, those may not be the same ones that satisfy that criteria in the past.
As I was out last week, I mentioned to people if you go back about 15 years and you think about our Upstream
portfolio, Tengiz was a real flagship asset. It was in the process of an expansion with SGI-SGP that took 100%
production from 350,000 barrels a day to 650,000 barrels a day or 700,000 barrels a day. Our share of that was
half, so we were on the way to the asset that we have today.
And the Permian was kind of out of sight, out of mind for most people. Our Australian LNG projects have not been
sanctioned. None of our LNG projects have been sanctioned and we were just beginning to move off of the shelf
into the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
If you think about it today, in Australia, we're producing 400,000 barrels of equivalent at nice cash margins. Tengiz
is on its way to 1 million barrels a day on 100% basis. Our share half of that, so 500,000 barrels a day. With
Permian, we outlined is on its way to 900,000 barrels a day our share and that doesn't stop when we get to that
number. The deepwater is â€“ with the combination of two companies is pushing close to 400,000 barrels a day.
So, we now have four positions that have scale, that have resource depth and length that have strong economics,
that have lots of running room and we have the ability to drive costs down and returns up through the way we
manage and invest in those resources over time.
So, it's a very different portfolio than one we would have had just one smaller asset and a lot of other ones then
that were required to have the scale to compete. So, we need to take a look at the rest of our portfolio and
determine those assets that really can still compete for capital and offer the low-cost, high-return characteristics,
the resource length and will compete for capital over time. I hope you're still with us, Jon. It sounds like you might
be evacuating.

Yes. Sorry, it's the classic timing of the annual, also the weekly test. Apologies for that.

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

All right. I'll be quick, so you can comply. So, we got every portfolio and we will look to make some decisions on
those assets that really will compete for capital that offer the resource potential and the value for our shareholders
over time. What those are, we'll disclose as we get into transactions. The capital that we've indicated, you should
think of it as both reductions and spend between the two companies and efficiency in that spend. So, we'll look at
contracts and the ability to execute and drive capital efficiency into the system and also drive overall spend down,
while at the same time investing more in the Permian, which is what we indicated our intention is to do. So, we'll
squeeze capital out of the combined system. We'll squeeze efficiency into the combined system and we will find
ways to accelerate activity in the Permian, which will bring value forward.

please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

Yeah, good morning. Hopefully you can hear me and I don't believe there are any problems in the background
right now. I guess, Mike, kind of an unusual situation here in terms of the bidding and typically you put your teams
together, you expect them to be very focused going forward. Was wondering in an environment like this, do you
end up having to divert people's attention to dealing with what may be an ongoing process here in terms of the
Anadarko bid? And then, how do you think about managing your way through that, kind of keeping everybody,
doing the things they need to do, plus the team that's focused here on the merger integration and all that stuff?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Look, I mentioned that we've put together joint integration teams already and that they met this week and this isn't
just a small group of people. This was a sizable group of people that spent multiple days together and we've got a
playbook for doing this. We did Unocal a decade ago, Texaco a few years before that. We have some of the
same people involved that led those integrations, and so people have their eye on the ball and are focused on
moving forward with things. And so, I'll just remind everyone, we've got a signed deal that's been approved by
both boards and we're moving forward with integration planning so we can deliver value.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

Okay. Well, good luck on that. Maybe to flip back and actually think about the operations here. In the quarter, we
saw a little lighter on the gas side globally, stronger on the crude side. Just curious how much of that is â€“ we had
some unplanned downtime, I believe, in Australia with the LNG. As you look going forward this kind of global mix
between oil and gas and taking into account maybe some dry gas remaining shut in in the Permian for a while.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, I mean, I do think what you saw was primarily some downtime at one of the trains in Australia at Gorgon,
and because that's a bigger part of our portfolio now and we've got a train down for some work, you'll see that.
The dry gas isn't a big number and so I wouldn't worry about that so much.
There's also some weather in Australia that created an impact. There's a cyclone that came through and we had
to take some slowdowns at both Wheatstone and Gorgon as we rode through that. But those are really the things
that are hitting the gas production.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

Just real quick if I could follow up on that. Is there any planned downtime between Gorgon and Wheatstone we
should consider as we look at the rest of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. We're moving into normal turnaround mode now for both of those. The plan at Gorgon would be to only
have one train down in any given year and so our plan right now would be to execute Train 1 on Gorgon later this
year.
The Upstream in aggregate from a turnaround standpoint, the turnaround season begins really in the second
quarter. You can think about the third quarter as probably the heaviest quarter because we'll have one of the KTL
lines at TCO in turnaround there. And then as we go third into fourth quarter, you'll see one train at Gorgon down
for a turnaround. But we're in the normal operations in turnaround cycle with the LNG plants.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

And Roger, this is Pierre. I mean, we generally will provide guidance if there's heavy Upstream turnaround activity
in the earnings call.

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting on the call. Mike, as you know, we're big fans of
what you guys have done here, but I want to ask a little bit of a sensitive question, if I may. There's been some
speculation, I guess some fact checking in the press, that given that Anadarko already had a bid in hand from
OXY per their letter, they then went ahead and increased their change of control for their senior management. I
wonder if you could speak to your opinion on that and what perspective you would offer in terms of, perhaps, the
history of your discussions that maybe led to that point. Obviously, it's a little bit sensitive, but it's something that
some shareholders are raising some concern about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Doug, there are numerous aspects of our negotiation and the deal that will be explained in the S-4 filing. It's
premature and inappropriate for me to comment on any of the aspects of how this all came together. I'd
encourage you just to read the S-4 when it's filed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

Okay. I knew it was going to be a tough one to answer, so I appreciate you trying. My more specific question to
Chevron is obviously post deal, there's going to be a very significant tailwind from synergies and all the things that
you've laid out. One assumes that if you did match the higher bid, does that change anything by way of your
buyback plans, dividend growth trajectory, any of those kind of issues? And what I'm really getting at is that, if for
some reason you did set a high bar where you did not decide to move forward in that event â€“ I realize it's unlikely
â€“ but the bulk of your future growth due to 2023 is largely looks like a lot of it is coming from Permian gas. So, I'm
just curious how, absent this deal, would you be able to sustain the buybacks and commit to a strong growth
trajectory for dividends? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. I'm not going to speculate on what Anadarko's board may do and how that plays out. I'll just tell you within
our base case, we produce 75% liquids in the Permian, so it's not primarily gas. We've indicated that we expect to
see our industry-leading cash margins sustained as the production grows and that we've initiated a buyback
program that we intend to stick with through any reasonable commodity price environment. And so, there are not
risks to be cached that would support shareholder distributions here in the vein of what you're talking about. So,
we're very confident in the plan we've laid out and our ability to deliver it.

Sam Margolin
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

Shouldn't be muted. Okay, sorry about that. I just have a quick question. We've been through a lot on the
Anadarko topic already. I've got a question for Pierre, a followup to that TCO topic earlier. If TCO keeps taking up
the co-lending program, theoretically it's to preserve dividends, but if that's happening at the same time that
commodity prices are broadly higher than what was planned for, does that flow into the Chevron capital program
as sort of like a net cash surprise? Or is the authorization part of your sort of free cash flow outlook and it's not
dynamic what TCO decides to do? And then, just as a followup, like if it's the former, does Chevron then have
headroom to rotate cash at the Chevron level into other things like Permian, incremental Permian for example?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. Thanks. And no, the financing doesn't impact capital, how we characterize capital. So, the capital is going
to be what is invested in the project. Again, that's affiliate capital, so non-cash capital. What can vary is â€“ where I
thought you were going is if prices are higher, then there's clearly more cash generation within TCO and,
therefore, their ability to balance, making investments and paying dividends is easier and they might pull less on
the loan. So, again, we're giving guidance on the financing, but it is subject to prices, level of investments that are
happening and the level of dividends. All of those are in interplay. But if prices stay higher longer, then that gives
the more flexibility to either decrease the lending or the borrowings or increase the dividend, which in either case
that's more cash to the company. It shows up in different parts of the cash flow statement, but in neither case
does that affect CapEx.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Sam Margolin

Q

Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Okay. Yeah, that's why I was asking because it sounded like there was a potential outcome where TCO is selffunding and inclusive of the dividend, but they still uptick the co-lending, in which case you got like surplus cash,
but I guess it's not. It wouldn't affect anything else, so okay.

Your question, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gabelman
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC

Q

Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I'm not going to ask you about the Anadarko deal because it seems like it's
been covered on the call. I wanted to actually ask about what's going on in California right now just given you
guys are â€“ have a pretty big footprint and the state commerce is in the process of reviewing a bill to kind of
institute a change in how oil production goes on there kind of the setback rules similar to what Colorado tried to
put forth. I'm wondering what you see as potential risks, if any, to your portfolio in the state both on the refining
side and the production side relative to that regulation. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay, Jason. Yeah. So, California has a pretty aggressive ideas on regulating our industry and what you referred
to is AB 345, which is in the assembly right now, wouldn't impact Downstream at all. It's really â€“ you can think of it
as analogous to what has been going on in Colorado and the primary concern is setbacks for activity.
Our portfolio in California is primarily in the San Joaquin Valley and it tends to be an area where it's not populated
in the same way the LA Basin is, which is where historically there was a lot of the roots of our company and a lot
of the industry traced their way back into the LA Basin. And so, there, you've got a much more densely populated
urban and suburban land use matrix and concerns about the proximity of drilling activities to residential, schools,
commercial, et cetera is really I think what's behind this.

So, we are working closely with the state government to ensure they understand the impacts. Others in the
industry and trade associations are as well and so it's prospective legislation that's being considered here. It really
impacts permitting for new wells. Doesn't impact things that are already on production. We got a big producing
business that's online today and then I think our portfolio is in a part of the state that would likely be less impacted
than if our production were more heavily concentrated into the LA Basin.
