Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings call and webcast. On the call with me today
are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are available on
Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2.
Turning to slide 3. And, Pierre?

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Wayne. We had another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. First, an overview of
our financial results.
Earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.36 per share. The quarter's results included a $430 million special item tax
accrual associated with a cash repatriation in the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange gains for the quarter were $74
million.
Excluding special items and FX gains, earnings were $2.9 billion or $1.55 per share. A reconciliation of nonGAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.
Cash flow from operations was $7.8 billion. We also maintained a strong balance sheet with a low debt ratio.
Importantly, our strong cash flow allowed us to continue to deliver significant cash to our shareholders. During the
quarter, we paid over $2 billion in dividends and repurchased $1.25 billion of shares, in line with our annual share
repurchase run rate guidance of $5 billion. Year to date, we've returned approximately $9.5 billion in dividend and
share repurchases.
Year-to-date organic CapEx was $14.5 billion, slightly below our ratable budget of $15 billion. Total CapEx, which
includes inorganic transactions that are unbudgeted, totaled $15 billion. We are maintaining a firm commitment to
capital discipline to improve returns on capital.

Turning to slide 4, third quarter cash flow was strong, down from the prior quarter due to lower Brent prices and
the absence of the termination fee received from Anadarko. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations of
nearly $22 billion funded all four of our financial priorities. With nearly $12 billion in free cash flow, we currently
have an annualized yield of about 7%, highlighting our ability to generate strong free cash flow in a lower oil price
environment. Through three quarters, the company's cash flow dividend breakeven price, excluding working
capital, is in the low $50s Brent.
Asset sales proceeds add to our positive cash flow and further lower the breakeven while high-grading our
portfolio. Since the beginning of 2018, asset sale proceeds have totaled $3 billion. And by year end, after the
expected closing of the sale of our UK North Sea assets, we will be near the low end of our $5 billion to $10 billion
guidance range with one year to go.
Turning to slide 5, third quarter 2019 earnings of $2.6 billion decreased about $1.5 billion versus prior year.
Excluding special items and FX, Upstream earnings declined primarily due to lower crude and natural gas prices,
partially offset by higher liftings. Downstream earnings also were down, primarily due to higher turnaround and
maintenance costs, lower volumes driven by the Southern Africa divestment, and lower Chemicals margins. The
variance in the Other segment primarily reflects lower corporate charges versus last year.
Turning to slide 6, compared to the second quarter, third quarter earnings decreased by about $1.7 billion.
Excluding special items and FX, Upstream results were lower, primarily due to a 10% decrease in Brent prices
since the second quarter. Downstream earnings, excluding FX, improved due to stronger refining and marketing
margins, partly offset by lower Chemical margins and the impacts of planned turnarounds. The variance in the
Other segment primarily reflects lower corporate charges and tax items.
I'll now pass it to Jay.

Thanks, Pierre.
On slide 7, third quarter oil equivalent production increased 3% compared to a year ago, with higher shale and
tight production in the Permian, as well as higher production from major capital projects following the ramp-ups at
Big Foot and Hebron. This growth was partly offset by unplanned downtime at Hibernia, asset sales, and the
impact of Hurricane Barry in the Gulf of Mexico.
Turning to slide 8, third quarter production was strong at more than 3 million barrels a day for the fourth
consecutive quarter, despite the impact of planned turnarounds and asset sales. Year-to-date production,
excluding asset sales, is about 5% higher than 2018, which is consistent with our earlier guidance of 4% to 7%,
as shown by the middle bar.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect production growth to be primarily driven by our shale and tight
assets as well as the continued ramp-up of Hebron.
Turning to slide 9, I'll provide an update on the TCO project. In the third quarter, we completed a detailed cost and
schedule review of the future growth and wellhead pressure management project in Kazakhstan. As a result, the
cost estimate for the project has been updated to $45.2 billion, with an additional $1.3 billion in contingency.

The expected startup of FGP has shifted to mid-2023 and will now follow WPMP, which remains on schedule for
startup in late 2022. The updated estimate has been submitted by TCO for shareholder approval.
Overall, the increase in total cost, including contingency, is about 25%. The waterfall shows the key drivers of the
updated estimate. As discussed previously, higher engineering costs and engineering impact on fabrication
consumed about two-thirds of the original contingency.
Additional construction costs represent the largest category of the revised estimate. More than half of the increase
in construction cost is due to higher quantities than originally estimated, including significant increases for
electrical and instrumentation, which was one of the last scopes of the engineering work to be completed. The
balance is primarily driven by higher unit construction rates due to higher market rates and more complex work
than originally anticipated.
Finally, the schedule and other category is primarily driven by the FGP schedule delay and increased costs for
operational readiness and the owner's team. Despite the increased project costs, TCO remains a world-class
asset that's expected to generate strong cash flow for many years.
Turning to slide 10, beginning in 2020, we expect spending to ramp down as we complete the project. The project
is approximately 70% complete. Detailed engineering and procurement are essentially complete, mitigating the
risk of further impact on fabrication or construction. Work at three of the four fabrication yards is complete. The
logistics system is working well. And the 2019 sealift has successfully concluded. Modules are being delivered,
restacked, and set on foundations as planned. Drilling is ahead of schedule, with 40 of the 55 wells drilled and
completed.
The lower chart on the slide shows the completed and remaining capital spend. Most of the remaining scope now
resides with construction and startup activities. Given the work completed, including two full years of onsite
construction experience, we believe we're on track to deliver the project in line with the updated estimate.
Importantly, we're not changing Chevron's capital guidance. Our 2020 capital, to be announced in December, will
be in the range of $18 billion to $20 billion. And we're reaffirming our capital guidance of $19 billion to $22 billion
for 2021 through 2023. We remain committed to capital discipline and delivering leading returns for our
shareholders.
Slide 11 highlights some recent commercial developments in our Upstream business. First, we recently
announced a farm-in agreement to take a 40% working interest in three Mexican blocks in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico.
We also recently participated in Brazil's 16th bid round and were awarded a 35% to 40% working interest in two
operated and three non-operated blocks. We're excited about these additions to our exploration portfolio.
Last week we signed an agreement to sell the company which holds our interest in the Malampaya gas fields in
the Philippines. We're expecting the transaction to close in the first half of 2020.
Now I'll turn it back to Pierre.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Jay.

And turning to slide 12, this quarter there were a number of highlights related to lowering the carbon intensity of
our operations. Earlier this month, we announced two new greenhouse gas reduction goals. The new goals are
aimed at reducing our oil emission intensity by 5% to 10% and our gas emission intensity by 2% to 5% in between
the years of 2016 and 2023. These are in addition to the targets we set at the beginning of the year to reduce our
flaring intensity and methane emissions over the same time period.
In Australia, we started up the Gorgon CO2 injection project in early August and are in the process of ramping it
up to full capacity. Once fully operational, this will be one of the world's largest carbon sequestration projects and
is expected to reduce Gorgon's greenhouse gas emissions by about 40% over the life of the project.
Lastly, construction is underway on a new 29-megawatt solar farm, which will supply electricity to Chevron's Lost
Hills Field (sic) [Lost Hills Oil Field] in California.
Now looking ahead, in Upstream, we expect full year 2019 production growth to be in the middle of the 4% to 7%
range, excluding 2019 asset sales. Asset sales, primarily in Denmark and Brazil, are forecasted to have a full year
impact near 30,000 barrels per day. Planned turnarounds, primarily in Gorgon and Nigeria, will be lower than the
third quarter, but are expected to impact production in the fourth quarter by more than 70,000 barrels per day.
As Jay mentioned earlier, we have acquired new exploration acreage in Brazil that is expected to add about $120
million in inorganic capital, which is unbudgeted.
Full-year TCO co-lending is expected to be below the full-year guidance of $2 billion, dependent primarily on the
fourth quarter distribution decision.
In Downstream, we expect high refinery turnaround activity. This includes a refinery-wide turnaround at SPRC in
Thailand, which occurs once every five years.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to make the $430 million tax payment, related to the cash repatriation, and to
repurchase shares of $1.25 billion.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Wayne.

Thanks, Pierre.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a
full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll do our best to get all of your questions
answered. Jonathan, please open the lines.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from
Jefferies. Your question, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gammel

Q

Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Thanks very much guys. I guess the first question related to the updated Tengiz budget. Given that a lot of the
spending is already behind you, do you anticipate that this is going to have any significant effects on the colending that you'll be making to the venture in the coming years?
And then maybe I'll just ask my second question now. The US Downstream earnings were pretty robust this
quarter relative to what I would have expected, just given a heavy turnaround schedule. Is it just the margin
environment that was you helping out? Or is there anything else that's happening in Downstream that is maybe
more ratable?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

All right. Thanks, Jason. This is Pierre. So on co-lending, we'll provide guidance for 2020 next quarter, as we have
in prior years. As you know, co-lending depends on three primary factors, the level of the capital spend, oil prices,
the macro environment, and any dividends.
And I guided in the fourth quarter that we expect the full year for 2019 to be lower than our $2 billion, but it will
vary depending on the fourth quarter dividend decision that TCO makes. So if the dividend is higher, the colending would be higher. If it's lower, the co-lending would be lower.
So if you go back to how this cost increase impacts co-lending, you really have to look at it as overall cash flow.
So clearly if you hold prices and dividend constant, higher capital costs will result in higher co-lending. But that
does not translate to lower Chevron cash, because we're going to offset the increases in TCO elsewhere in our
capital program.
And so if you remember, TCO capital spend is non-cash. And co-lending turns part of it into cash, because we
think it's the most economic way to finance our share of the TCO spending. But again, we're going to have offsets
elsewhere in our capital program, which will be cash CapEx. And that'll help offset that higher co-lend.
If we go to Downstream in the quarter, we don't – there's nothing that isn't inherent in the underlying margins that I
can really point out to. We've had – distillate margins have popped up a little bit. And we tend to have some more
production in that space. You're seeing some of the effects of IMO are rolling through the system. I mean West
Coast margins had some strength at times in the quarter.
But I would attribute the third quarter performance largely to how we operated and the underlying margin
environment.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question
please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Philip M. Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Yes, hi, good morning. First question, just coming back to the idea that the Tengiz CapEx increase will not affect
the overall capital spending plan. Is this – are we just talking here about the fact that perhaps you're at low end of
CapEx ranges, and now you move to high end of CapEx ranges? Or how do you calibrate being able to offset $4
billion to $5 billion of incremental spending to Chevron within the budget? Is it activity elsewhere? Or is it just
within ranges here we're talking about? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

So there's a couple different places that we look to. First, TCO itself in its base capital spend has offset and will
continue to offset some of the increase in the FGP spend.
Beyond that though, as Pierre was talking about, we have a much more flexible capital program now with a lot of
short cycle activity. And we're able to pace and adjust that program to fit within the investment levels that we set.
And particularly as it relates to gas related investments, are opportunities for us in this current environment to
scale back some of that as appropriate. And those are things we may have done anyway.
And the final thing is just the capital efficiency that we're driving throughout the business. Our base business
performance has been very strong. We have digital initiatives, trying to reduce our – make our capital spend more
effective. And so right across the board, people are figuring out ways to do more with less.
I'll give you a good example. Was in Bangladesh recently, where instead of making a major capital project to add
some additional compression, the team was able to look at recompleting some wells, adding some perforations,
and doing some debottlenecking on existing facilities, which extended the production plateau and alleviated the
need for incremental capital spend on another project.
So it's these types of spending that we constantly are working through as we allocate our capital each year. We're
going to remain capital disciplined. We're going to stay within the ranges that we've given you. And we're going to
look to do it, while we stay focused on delivering the value and returns that are really what's driving our decisions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

And if I can just build off of Jay's answer there. And just to be very specific. No, we do not intend to go from the
low end to the high end of the range. We intend to find offsets through the way that Jay has talked about.


We have a range, because we're giving guidance out to 2023. It is a cyclical business. Oil prices can change.
COGS can change. We have short cycle capital that we can flex up or down, as Jay mentioned. But so the intent
of the range, we still want to keep the range for what it's there for. And our intent is to offset increase elsewhere.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Philip M. Gresh

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Okay, all right. Thank you for that color. And then, I guess, just a follow-up would be for Jay. I'm just trying to kind
of rewind here back to a year or so ago. There were some fears that things were getting a bit behind in Tengiz.
And then back at the Analyst Day, the tone sounded much better that things were back on track.
And now we have a 25% increase, which is fairly sizable. So I'm just hoping you could provide a little bit more
color about how these things have progressed to the point that we have this kind of increase? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. I think what's changed fundamentally is we completed a very detailed cost and schedule review in the third
quarter. So that's just been completed.
And as we looked at it, there were a couple of key elements. We've talked in the past about the overall
engineering program, the cost of that program, and the impact the engineering has had on fabrication and
construction. And you can see those in the first two bars of page 9 – slide 9. And that really reflects that
accelerated consumption of contingency that we've talked about in the past.
What was frankly a surprise was the increase in quantities that we're seeing coming out of the late stages of
engineering, particularly related to things like the electrical and instrumentation, controls, fire and gas, some of the
late changes in how we're going to do the backfill and quantities associated with it. Those drove a much higher
construction cost than we had anticipated. And if you look at the third bar, you see that represented.
The other big surprise was having to delay the startup of FGP by a year. This is really driven fundamentally by an
assumption change. We had planned to integrate modules. Our estimate was based on the integration of the
modules in FGP, each one taking about 12 months from the time it was placed on its foundation until it was fully
integrated.
While we're seeing very complete modules come from the fabrication yard, just as we've gotten a year of ME&I
experience this year, our view has changed that we're using 14 months as our planning basis. And that's pushed
that schedule time out.
So the growth in quantities and the longer schedule have really been the surprises that we didn't anticipate
previously. So that's really where we are at this point in time.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question,
please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Yes, thank you. So the first question, just on the Permian and the glide path here. You continue to trend above
your target levels. Maybe just talk, Jay, with some detail about how the plan is progressing in the Permian? And
any comments that you would have on sort of this upcoming US election? And any impacts the way you think
about prosecuting your acreage?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

I'll start with just the performance in the Permian. Our view, as you know, has been to be very disciplined and
focused on returns and efficiency. And we have seen continued performance improvement in our drilling in
particular. Our completions have remained very strong throughout. And so we're watching every segment of the
value chain from the actual land acquisition to fill in some of the checkerboards and allow the longer laterals, right
through the drilling efficiency into the completions, the facilities, and on production. And then working with our
marketing and transportation group to ensure that we're getting the highest realizations we can for the products
that we're producing. So we're on plan. We're actually, as we said, doing very well with our production profile.
We're pleased with the performance that we're seeing, but we're always driving for better performance.
In terms of the upcoming election, look, hydraulic fracturing has been done for millions of wells, not only in the US
but around the world. It's done safely. It's done effectively. We learn more about it all the time. And it's really
unlocked a huge economic benefit for the country as well as for the companies involved. It's also unlocked some
environmental benefits in terms of the proliferation of gas, which isn't always to our benefit from a profit
standpoint, but it's a great fuel for the US.
If you look at it from our company standpoint, we have less than about 10% of our Permian unconventional
acreage that is on federal land, and all of that is in New Mexico. So from a relative standpoint, while we would not
like to see any kind of restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, that's the context for our company.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

No, that's great. I appreciate it. And then the follow-up here is related to Brazil. There's the upcoming transfer of
rights auction. And you called out some of your increased exploration acreage there. Can you provide some
context in terms of the way that Chevron thinks about Brazil and how aggressive it sees itself being there over the
next couple years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

We've talked before that we are very happy actually with our existing resource base. We've been doing a lot of
portfolio work, as you know, over the last several years to really clean up our portfolio. And part of that has been a
reload of our exploration strategy.

But because we're happy with our resource base, we have primarily focused on reloading in the exploration space
because we're looking for resource additions out in the future, and we also want to manage our capital over the
period of time. So our focus has been on exploration opportunities. That's what you've seen us do in Brazil. And
our focus has been that way.
We are interested in Brazil, because we see the pre-salt as a prolific hydrocarbon basin. It's a good place to be to
increase the probability of success on exploration, and we'll stay focused on that. We have a couple of wells
coming up next year, which will be good wells for us. We're looking forward to seeing those results. But we'll
continue to stay focused primarily on exploration as we look forward.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng

Q

Jay, I don't want to beat a dead horse on Tengiz, but what have you learned from Tengiz to further fine tune your
development and project execution process? Clearly there, something was not working in order for us – at this
stage to have the delay for a year and also that for 25% increase. So what have we learned?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Paul, it's a good question. We ask ourselves all the time, how can we do better? Clearly, this is a disappointment.
I'm very disappointed because we have taken all the lessons learned from the past and tried to make sure we're
building those into each project as we go forward.
When we think about what's gone well, there have been a lot of dimensions to this. Particularly the execution work
is going very well. I'm happy with the way the fabrication work has gone in the yards. The modules are coming out
very complete and dimensionally accurate. When we set them on their foundation, everything is lining up. The
logistics system has been flawless. The performance is exactly how we had planned, and it's delivering modules
to the site very effectively. And we've been able to complete the sealift for 2019. So we're happy on all those
fronts.
The schedule delay is a disappointment, and that has to do a lot with the quantity growth we saw in engineering.
And as we've said, we've been unhappy with the overall engineering performance on this project, not only the
engineering costs themselves, but the impact it's had on fabrication and construction. We need to do better in this
area. And it's an area that we're going to continue to learn our lessons from this and build it forward.
We don't have any other very large mega projects like this that are land-based anywhere in the world at the
current time. So we've got time to take these lessons learned and really think about how we approach this
differently in the future. Our commitment remains on capital discipline. Our commitment remains to execute this
project to the best of our ability.
When you look at the improvements taking place on the ground in Tengiz, in 2018 we talked about productivity
that we needed to improve. And we saw 40% to 50% improvement in productivity across the site. In 2019, this
year, we've seen another 30% to 40% improvement in productivity. So we're seeing great improvements with the
production, the construction management system, production management systems. And we're going to continue
to stay focused on productivity, on completing work, and moving it to mechanical completion, and then getting it
through systems completion and into startup.

Jay...

Pierre R. Breber

And if I could just build off of Jay's answer, Paul, just to put this in an enterprise perspective, the additional
depreciation after tax to Chevron is less than $0.20 per share or less than the cash flow impact of $1 change in oil
prices. So as Jay said, we own this and we need to do better. And trust me, we're fighting for every dollar. But I
did want to put in perspective what this means for a company like Chevron.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng

have we learned? And what is the change will be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

From an engineering standpoint, Paul, I think we have a couple things. One is we are doing more to bring the
early engineering back in-house and do more focused design development with our own capabilities. And we're
trying to minimize the amount of variation that we see in terms of each project team's decisions that they make
around engineering. I think that's a key part of it. And I think looking at the total project in the context of the
environment it's going to be built is also important.
I do think there are also opportunities for the industry to improve on engineering. I don't think this is necessarily
isolated to our company. So there's work to be done as we really understand how to better define and prosecute
the engineering programs that are necessary for these projects.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

And if I can just – what Jay said is we don't have projects like this in our queue. If you look at our capital program,
a lot of base business capital, shale and tight capital.
We are going to have some major capital projects. But the ones that are coming up are deepwater projects, and
they're very different than these. A lot of the spending is in drilling and completion, where we're very good. On the
facilities side, it tends to be standard designs in fabrication yards. As Jay said, it's not land-based projects in
remote locations. And we have a better track record in those types of projects.
So again, we need to do better. We're learning from it. From an enterprise perspective, the portfolio, the
investments that are at least in front of us are hitting a different place than where this project has been.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng

Q

Analyst, Scotia Howard Weil

My final question, guys. Jay and Pierre, I think in Tengiz, even before the cost increase, the full project return on
capital – the full cycle internal rate of return is actually pretty low. And with this then, of course it's much lower. But
the cash flow will be great once they come onstream. So which is a more important factor when you guys
determine whether you want to go with a certain project? Is it the internal rate of return, or is it the cash flow and
the sustainability of that cash flow, say, for how long? So I'm just trying to understand the decision-making
process.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Look, I'll start, and maybe Jay will add some comments. You've heard Jay and Mike [Wirth] and myself are all
talking about increasing returns on capital. So we are focused on the return on investment. And so we are looking
at it. And once you have a cost increase, I think it's stating the obvious that that dilutes the returns. And we're
taking a lot of actions to offset that, both in Tengiz and across the rest of the portfolio.
I tried to give, again, some financials that kind of characterize what the impact is, again, on a company like
Chevron, less than $0.20 per share. But we are looking fundamentally at returns on capital, but we also know
cash is important. It helps pay the dividend and support the share buybacks.

I would just say this particular project, Paul, I know your views on it have been the same for a long time. But this is
an important project for Tengiz. It does lower the back pressure on all the wells and addresses the declining
reservoir pressure that we see there.
It provides excess gas handling, which will unlock oil production in our existing facilities as well as for FGP. And it
helps maintain reservoir pressure in the platform, which is an important aspect of the overall performance of
Tengiz, not just the incremental performance.
There also, as Pierre said, we're looking at ways that this can be offset. And one of the key milestones that was
achieved was the decision to debottleneck the CPC pipeline. And so that's going to open up some additional
export capacity, which will improve realizations and help boost returns and help mitigate and offset some of the
increases that we're seeing on project cost.

So I wanted to follow-up on some of the exploration discussion from earlier. You talked a little bit about Brazil. But
you also highlighted in the release and slides some additional blocks in the offshore Gulf of Mexico. And I think
you've been fairly active in the US Gulf of Mexico leasing as well.
As we kind of step back and look at where you're seeing the most opportunity from here, can you talk a little bit
more about that and the overall strategy here? And the desire, if any, to diversify growth options away from shale
and tight? But I think you mentioned there were some larger capital projects offshore potentially in the pipe. So a
little more color on that would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

Thanks for the question. So in addition to deepwater Brazil, we have been very interested in some of the
deepwater in the Mexican areas of the Gulf of Mexico. And this plays on a lot of the knowledge we already have
in the US sector of the Gulf of Mexico. So we've recently farmed into some additional blocks. And these
complement nicely some blocks we'd acquired in an earlier bid round.
One of our strategies has been to move out of more of the frontier, highly speculative areas and really focus our
exploration initiatives in the areas that we consider to be highly prolific basins. And that really increases our
probability of success.
At the same time we're doing that, we're trying to balance the amount of capital that would – goes in early and
really use the fact that some of this is only under 2D seismic or lightly explored to open up new opportunities for
development.
In the US Gulf of Mexico, we've been very active. And one of the key strategies in the US Gulf is to focus a lot of
our new blocks around existing infrastructure. And we're looking to push that envelope of how far we can tie back
exploration opportunities or discoveries to existing infrastructure and avoid having to build brand new greenfield.
A couple of examples of that would be, for example, you recently heard about the Esox discovery with another
operator. That'll tie back to Tubular Bells. It's very close. It brings new production in at very low capital cost and
with a very short cycle time.
So those are kind of the low cost, high return subsea tiebacks that are being enabled and supported by our
exploration strategy in the US Gulf of Mexico.
We're also talking about extending that reach, as I said, through some of the new technology. We have used quite
successfully the single phase seafloor pumping at Jack and St. Malo and really proven that technology. And we've
now finished the technical certification to move to multi-phase pumping. And this can really extend that radius, of
which we can pull production back to existing hosts that have ullage.
So it's entirely in line with our theme of exploring in prolific basins, but also utilizing existing infrastructure and
getting more out of our existing facilities whenever possible.

Q

Got it. Great. And my second is on some of the comments around incremental efficiencies you're realizing across
the portfolio, as one of the things you mentioned in response to the Tengiz cost pressure. And, Pierre, I think you
mentioned it also as an area where you've seen success across the portfolio in your prepared remarks.
So I was hoping to get a bit more specifics on where within the portfolio you're seeing those capital efficiency
improvements. And then also, to the extent you are cutting back capital in more gassy areas in response to the
Tengiz pressure, any additional detail on where that is. North America? Gas elsewhere in the portfolio? Additional
color would be helpful there as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. The increased efficiencies, quite honestly, are happening across the board. All of our units are really
focused on how to continue to drive better performance out of the investments we've made in the past. We've
seen some great improvements in particular, for example, in Angola, where they have developed some new
opportunities by using our existing installed base.
We saw a very strong cash flow coming out of Angola. And there's been a lot of good cooperative work with the
government of Angola to unlock many of the marginal reserves that can be tied back to our existing facilities. But
it really is happening around the world.
In terms of the Gulf of Mexico, we've seen our unit development cost come down to where we're now targeting
$16 to $20 a barrel for new facilities. And projects like Anchor and Whale, certainly we're targeting in that range.
The OpEx in the Gulf of Mexico in the deepwater has come down to just under $10 a barrel, which is a significant
reduction from where we were in 2014.
We're taking these lessons learned, we're sharing them across other areas in the company to make sure that –
it's one thing to share, it's another to adopt these best practices. But we're seeing great cooperation between our
business units. And we're going to be really focused on doing that even more as we move forward.
All of this isn't just in response to Tengiz. But rather it's the context of Tengiz in this environment that's allowing us
to do this, and I think do it quite efficiently.
In terms of the specifics on where in our capital program we'll be making changes, that's not something that we'll
discuss at this point in time. But we'll give more color on that potentially in December with our capital
announcement and of course in the SAM, the Security Analyst Meeting, that we do early in the year each year.

Q

Hey, thanks for taking my question. Sorry, I have another one on Tengiz. Jay, you mentioned the significant
productivity improvements in 2018, 2019. But taking that on board, that would suggest the CapEx increase was
coming quite a long time ago. So I guess just want to square that comment with the CapEx increase today and
the timing of that.
But taking a step back. You look at the last few years, and you've had your fair share of issues at some of these
major projects. Pierre, you're signing off on these. I just wonder if these experiences make you think twice about
embarking on these types of projects of this scale in the future? That would be my first question. And I've got
another follow-up. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

So on the productivity, the contracts at site at Tengiz and the construction are largely unit rates. So we pay based
on the quantities that are being installed.
But the productivity is important, because it relates to the underlying schedule and the ability to finish the work
and execute the work in the timeframe that we've got. And with the numbers of people we planned, because
there's a lot of indirects that come with having to add additional direct labor.
So while the unit rates have been in place, it's really the complexity that has increased on some of the man hours.
We've talked in the past about the unit rate costs that were in our bids for the mechanical, electrical, and
instrumentation work. But really the surprise has been the increase in quantities, because when you multiply the
quantities times those rates, that's what's resulting in the higher cost. And as I said the shift in schedule.
So that's how I square that with what we've given you in the past. And really what came out of the detailed cost
and schedule review that we just completed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. And, Biraj, in terms of – I think I addressed this. I mean we don't have other projects like FGP/WPMP in our
queue. Kitimat is being worked, but it's not ready. What we have is a lot of base business capital, a lot of shale
and tight, and hopefully some deepwater projects here over time.
So I understand your question. It's theoretical. I'm not going to speculate about it. But as I look at our portfolio
right now, we don't have that choice.
That said, we're going to be in the business a long time. We're going to learn from it. We have to do better. But we
don't have any immediate capital decisions that are in this kind of a large scale land based construction project.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Biraj Borkhataria

Q

Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.

Okay, understood. Just to follow-up, hopefully, an easier question. But the tax on repatriated cash, are you
expecting that to be a one-off? Or is it – should we expect more of these in the future? And can you confirm
whether that was cash tax or just a P&L charge? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

So thanks for that question. So we completed a global cash management review in the third quarter and decided
to repatriate this cash, which was previously unremitted. So prior to completing this review, these earnings were
expected to be invested outside the US, and that's why we didn't accrue for the state and forward withholding
taxes. So when we made the decision to repatriate it, that's when we accrue the tax.
So it is a cash tax, but the cash – the tax payment will be in the fourth quarter. We accrued the P&L, was in the
third quarter. And the actual cash movement – so this will bring non-US cash into the US. It will allow us to lower
our cash balances, will lower our debt balances. We're doing it because it's the right economic decision. And this
is for prior earnings. We do not expect other types of repatriations of prior earnings like this. At the same time,
there could be some current earnings that, of course, are repatriated, and that's in the normal course of business.
So no, this is a one-off. It's over $8 billion of non-US cash being brought to the US. You won't see our US cash
balances go down by that full amount, because some of it had been lent into the US. But we expect our year-end
cash balances to be $3 billion to $4 billion lower than where we ended the third quarter. And we ended the third
quarter a little bit high because we were preparing for some of these moves to repatriate the cash.

Thanks, everybody. Good morning. Jay, I know you don't – or maybe, Pierre, I know you guys don't normally want
to talk about fiscal terms. But in light of the Tengiz cost increases, I just wondered if you could just remind us or
walk us through what the implications are for cost recovery. Because I'm guessing that with existing production
and lack of ring-fencing and so on, the net impact of this may not be as severe as obviously the headline cost
overrun suggests. I just wonder if you could walk us through what the cost recovery ramifications are, please. And
I've got a follow-up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

This is a tax and royalty contract in Tengiz. And so it's really going to be through the DD&A and the way that flows
through the books in terms of the recovery. So it's impacting returns more than it will the actual cash flow once we
get past the startup of the facility.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate

Q

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Okay, I'm sorry. I thought there was an accelerated piece to that. Thanks.
My follow-up is really more going back to the Permian. Obviously, the plan you've laid out is continuing to – you
continue to outperform against at least the production profile. But when you laid out the plan, you talked about
when you would expect the Permian to be cash breakeven in terms of capital and cash flow and obviously royalty
contribution and so on. Obviously, NGL and gas prices have deteriorated quite materially. So I'm wondering if you
could just update your thoughts on that.
And specifically on the takeaway solutions that you've announced over the last several months, what does that do
to your ability to improve gas and NGL realizations? Are those lease line? Or are they going to uplift your
realizations with more working a Gulf Coast type metric to it? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

We went through a lot of this, Doug, as you know, in the second quarter call. And that guidance still stands. In
terms of the crude takeaway capacity, we have sufficient capacity, not just to produce it into the basin, but to take
it to Houston. And now we have export capacity opening up as well, 35% now and 40% in 2020. So that's the
crude side of things. NGLs are sufficient through 2020.
And in terms of gas, our primary focus was to make sure we have evacuation capacity in the basin, and we have
100% of that covered. Our view and our practice is that we have no routine flaring of gas to enable production,
and we've been able to honor that.
In terms of moving gas out of the basin, right now we have about 25% capacity. And it's going to vary based on
how these different pipelines come on stream. But by the second quarter of 2021, we're expecting to have about
80% of our gas flowing out of the basin. We are still expecting to have free cash flow positive next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

Jay, just to be clear, is it 60% – 65% gas and NGLs? Or can you – I know you talk about liquids, but can you split
the oil versus NGL portion? And I'll leave it at that. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

We see roughly half of our total mix is in crude. About a quarter of it's in gas liquids, and about a quarter of it's in
natural gas.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Dan Boyd

Q

Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)

Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, I just want to actually follow up again on the TCO spend. And if I recall
correctly, last year you spent about $600 million more than you initially budgeted. So what I'm wondering is how
much of the overrun is going to be already spent or in the budget by the end of this year? That's the first question.
And then the follow-up is, when I look at your total CapEx budget, in order to be below the $20 billion for next
year, given that affiliate spending will still stay high, are you implying that your cash CapEx could potentially be
down next year? And I'm just wondering if there's a potential production impact of that, or if the Permian is running
ahead of schedule enough to offset any of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

So a couple things, Dan. First of all, I'd take you to slide 10. And that shows our production – or our spending
profile for the FGP project. And we see 2018 and 2019 as our peak years of spend. And as we look to 2020, we'll
start spending at a lower rate as we move and consolidate really the activities largely into site construction work.
We have one more year of fabrication to go in one of the four original yards, and that work is currently about 73%
complete.
In terms of how to allocate the incremental spend over the total project, I would say roughly it's about half of it
behind us, half of it, about $4 billion to $5 billion in front of us. But as we look at it, it's really in that increased
construction cost where we see the majority of the increase and the surprise. The part that we did in the first
engineer – or the engineering and fabrication was more directed around the consumption of contingency. The
increases we've really seen have been in construction and schedule.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

So, Dan, again, just to build off Jay's comments. I mean we're coming off of – we affirmed the guidance for next
year between $18 billion to $20 billion. TCO will be coming off as Jay said. And so we have – we're doing – we're
finalizing our plan and our capital program right now.
But we have – between the efficiencies that Jay talked about and choices we can make around deferring low
return projects, we absolutely have the capability of landing a capital program in that range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


Dan Boyd

Q

Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)

Okay. And the production outlook more than offset that in other areas?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, I mean we haven't given production guidance year by year. We've given the 3% to 4% production outlook
to 2023, so no change to that.
Again, some of the examples, some of the offsets do not impact production. Clearly if we defer some lower return
natural gas investments, or we decide to flex down some of our shorter cycle spend, that could have a modest
impact on production. But there are other things that are going better, like the Permian and other offsets that we're
trying to manage.
So we will give our usual one-year outlook on production guidance on the fourth quarter call in late January.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

Good morning. Thank you. I guess maybe it's been mentioned a couple different times, the weakness in gas.
Maybe as you think about global gas markets, LNG, what you're seeing in terms of any additional risk we should
think about on the spot market side or on the contracted side for LNG?
And then as a little add-on to that, just kind of an update of how Gorgon and Wheatstone are performing here?
And planned and unplanned maintenance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. Gorgon and Wheatstone are actually performing quite well. Gorgon Train 1 is currently under a scheduled
turnaround, a planned turnaround.
But as you saw, our third quarter production – and there's a slide in the back – was very strong out of both
Gorgon and Wheatstone. And we continue to stay focused on enhancing the reliability and the utilization of those
facilities as well as creeping the capacity.

We have a turnaround schedule that is going to be planned for both of those. And it'll be an annual event. Those
will be – we'll talk about those as we get closer to them. We have another train for Gorgon next year that has
been announced.
And these will be done to allow us to get into a regular rotation of turnaround, so they can be done safely and
efficiently, just as we do in our Downstream facilities and places like Tengiz.
We do see the potential for spot to be higher as we increase production. As we hit stronger production, we will
have more cargoes available for spot. That's a good thing, because we actually have more production than we'd
planned for.
But over time as the reliability continues to strengthen, we would expect to try and term up some of that
anticipated spot cargo and reduce the amount of spot in any given quarter relative to either long term or medium
term contracts that we've put in place.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. The only thing to add, and Jay mentioned this in second quarter, we have seen some customers downward
flex on the long term contracts. This is something that is within contractual limits and within the contractual terms.
They have to do it almost a year ahead. It's tied to the annual delivery schedule.
But we have seen some of that. And that has resulted in a little bit more in the spot market than we otherwise
would have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read

for the summer time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, in terms of calling – and look, it looks – the macro on spot LNG looks sort of structurally oversupplied. Of
course, a cold winter can certainly fix a fair amount of that. But storage levels in Europe are full. Asia seems to be
well positioned.
So if I look at it right now, again, it looks oversupplied. And there's more LNG coming on. But markets surprise us
all the time. I mean the takeaway for us is we are just not really exposed to the spot market. We are primarily
selling under oil linked, long term contracts.

Q

So my first question is on the Permian, and it's probably for Jay. I think it's well-understood that your leading edge
wells perform better and better.
I'm interested, as the base gets bigger and is more important to the overall production targets, how your first
generation wells look? If your EURs that you projected look like they're intact or growing or changing in any way?
And if there's sort of rigless activity work, workover stuff that you have to do that you had modeled or maybe it's
less than what you modeled? But just any update on kind of your older wells and how that component of the
Permian is shaping up today would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

That's a good question, Sam. Thank you. When we look at our production performance out of our wells, the early
horizontal wells have actually performed as we expected them to perform. And so our EURs have been consistent
with expectation for the wells as we move through.
As we have continued to evolve, though, our basis of design and our completion strategies, we've seen higher
and higher EURs. And the new wells, of course, are meeting those expectations as well. So overall, the program
is working as planned.
The newer wells, as you point out, are much more productive than some of the older wells. But they're all meeting
the expectations that we've set for them at the time in the aggregate.
Obviously, any individual well may be higher or lower than planned. But as a portfolio, as a program, we've been
overall pleased with the performance. And that's really what's underpinning our ability to deliver the production
profile you can see on the chart in the appendix.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Sam Margolin

Q

Okay, thanks so much. And then just a follow-up. Pierre, you get this question all the time about the leverage
profile on the balance sheet. But the net debt continues to fall. The ratio of your free cash flow annualized – in not
a great year – to net debt is like 1.5 times.

Is there a level of net debt that you think is under-levered or suboptimal for the business, especially in the context
of Tengiz? If the biggest impact is a return impairment, you could enhance that to the equity with some leverage
deployed somehow. So just your thoughts on how net debt's trending? And what optimal leverage is?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. No, thanks, Sam. And, look, yeah, we are generating good cash in a challenging macro environment.
I think you know our four financial priorities. I'll go through them quickly. The first is to sustain and grow the
dividend, and we increased it 6% earlier this year.
The second is to reinvest capital in the business, and you heard Jay reaffirm our capital guidance. So we are not
going to add to our capital program.
The third is to maintain a strong balance sheet, and that's what you're asking. I'll get to that.
And the fourth is our buyback program that we intend to sustain through the cycle, and we have that at a $5 billion
annual rate.
So what happens in the short term, clearly, if we generate more cash than those three requirements – in
particular, the dividend, which we increased earlier this year; the capital program, which we're holding flat; and the
buyback program – then it goes to the balance sheet.
That's where it's going to go in the short term. That's just how the math works. But over time, we expect if those
conditions continue, without speculating about future dividend increases or share buybacks, over time that cash
should be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividends and a sustained buyback program.
Because as you say, we don't need to be an even stronger credit. We have the leading balance sheet in the
industry. We have the strongest balance sheet in the industry. And I've talked about a gross debt to capital ratio of
20% to 25%. We're well below that. I'm comfortable being below that, because that's again the outcome of our
cash generation profile, depending on where the macro environment – obviously, that can change.
But we are very well positioned to grow dividends, sustain the buyback, invest in the business, and maintain a
strong balance sheet.

Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to firstly quickly confirm that 2019 CapEx hasn't changed as a
result of the TCO overspend.
And then, secondly, just wanted to get your thoughts on M&A. That hasn't been addressed this call. I think in the
past, you've discussed wanting to kind of expand or potentially acquire some company that operates in multiple
arenas, not just one that operates in US shale. I'm wondering if that's still the way you're thinking about M&A. And
how the opportunity set looks right now? Thanks.

Yeah. Thanks, Jason. On your first question on capital for this year, our capital budget on an organic basis is $20
billion. Year to date, we're at $14.5 billion, so we're basically on track.
We've had some modest inorganic capital year to date. That's been the Pasadena refinery primarily. And we
guided to a little bit for the Brazil exploration bid around. So again, we're on track for delivering an organic capital
program in line with our budget of $20 billion.
In terms of M&A, I'm not going to speculate on that. I think you've heard us talk about it.
Look, we have a very strong value proposition. We have a 4% dividend yield, a 2% share buyback – or the
buyback equivalent to 2% of the shares, a free cash flow yield of 7%, an advantaged portfolio that Jay has been
talking about with strong resources and reserves that allow us to grow cash flow and grow production over time.
So we don't need to do a deal.
All that said, at times in the past we have been opportunistic when we think it's in the interest of our shareholders.
It is difficult to make M&A work for our shareholders. And right now, we think we have a very good value
proposition on our own for our shareholders. Thanks, Jason, appreciate the question.
