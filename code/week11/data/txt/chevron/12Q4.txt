Operator: Good morning. My name is Shawn, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to the
Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that
time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr.
John Watson. Please go ahead, sir.

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Okay, thanks, Shawn. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call
with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Chief Financial Officer, and Jeff Gustavson, who's the General Manager of
Investor Relations. We'll of course refer to slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started,
please be reminded that the presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements.
We ask that you review the usual cautionary statement that we have on Slide 2.
Turning to Slide 3, I want to begin where we always do, with safety. We continue to achieve world-class low
industrial injury and illness rates. We had our lowest ever days-away-from-work rate, and once the data is
finalized, we expect to again lead the industry for the second consecutive year on this measure. We're also focused
on process safety, with many successes. Last year we had our fewest number of spills ever, which translated to
record low spill volume. We believe this too will be the best in the industry.
Having said this, it was not a perfect year. We do believe that zero incidents is attainable. We're not there yet, but
we're striving to learn and improve to get to incident-free operations.
Our financial performance in 2012 was quite strong. We expect, when all the 2012 results are in, to again post the
highest upstream earnings per barrel by a significant margin and to be very near the top in downstream earnings
per barrel as well. These excellent financial results validate our strategies and the many past investment decisions.
I would like to summarize just a few additional accomplishments from last year. In our upstream business, we are
steadily progressing our major capital projects. The Gorgon project was over 55% complete at year-end, and
Wheatstone has made good progress as well, both from a construction standpoint and in securing off-take
commitments through several new long-term LNG supply agreements. We've just posted a short video of recent
Gorgon construction progress on our Web page at chevron.com. I encourage you to take a few minutes to view the
video. The progress is quite impressive.
We also continued construction activities on our projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where Big Foot and
Jack/St. Malo are both on budget and on schedule for start-up in 2014. We achieved start-up at Usan and Agbami
Phase II developments in Nigeria, as well as Caesar/Tonga, Tahiti-2 deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico. We
continue to expand our discovered resource base with asset acquisitions in the Delaware Basin in the U.S. and in
western Canada through an agreement to join the Kitimat LNG project.

We also grew our exploration portfolio by acquiring positions in several new areas, including the Kurdistan region
of Iraq, Suriname, Sierra Leone, Lithuania, and the Ukraine. Our reserve replacement ratio was 112%, with adds
distributed broadly across our upstream portfolio.
In our downstream business, we completed our three-year restructuring plan and have delivered on the
commitments made when we first began simplifying our business, streamlining our portfolio, reducing costs, and
improving returns, all while retaining scale where we have competitive positions. We also continued to make
progress on key growth projects in our lubricants and chemical businesses.
We're very proud of our performance this past year. With that, I'll turn it over to Pat, who'll take you through our
financials. Pat?

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay, thank you, John. Slide 4 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter
earnings were $7.2 billion, or $3.70 per diluted share. For the year, earnings were an impressive $26.2 billion.
This equates to $13.32 per diluted share, nearly tied with 2011's record performance. Return on capital employed
for the year approached 19%, and our debt ratio at year-end was 8.2%. 2012 marked our 25th consecutive annual
dividend increase, with an 11.1% rise in the quarterly rate. This demonstrates our confidence in our future
performance and is consistent with our priority of rewarding our shareholders with sustained and competitive
dividend growth.
In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares, bringing the full-year share repurchase total to
$5 billion. In the first quarter of 2013, we expect to repurchase the same amount, $1.25 billion of shares. Finally,
Chevron's 2012 TSR was 5%. We continue to lead our peer group on total shareholder returns for the three-year,
the five-year, and the 10-year periods, as well as all periods in between. And you probably noticed we are also off
to a strong TSR start so far this year.
Turning to Slide 5, cash generated from operations was $12.9 billion during the fourth quarter. For the full year,
cash from operations was nearly $39 billion, reflecting our impressive operating performance and the cashgenerating strength of our portfolio. At year-end, our cash balances totaled $22 billion. This kept us in a net cash
position of about $10 billion at year-end. Our strong cash flow and solid balance sheet continue to be a
competitive advantage.
Now on Slide 6, I'll compare the results of fourth quarter 2012 with the third quarter of 2012. As a reminder, our
earnings release compares fourth quarter 2012 with the same quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter earnings were
$7.2 billion, nearly $2 billion higher than third quarter results. Upstream earnings increased $1.7 billion,
reflecting increased gains on asset transactions and higher liftings. Downstream results were up $236 million
between quarters, driven by favorable inventory effects and gains on asset transactions. The variance in the Other
bar reflects a favorable swing in corporate tax items, partially offset by higher corporate charges.
On Slide 7, our U.S. upstream earnings for the fourth quarter were $241 million higher than third quarter's
results. Higher realizations improved earnings by $40 million, driven largely by a 22% increase in natural gas
realizations. Higher production volumes increased earnings by $85 million between periods, reflecting recovery in
production post-Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico and increased production associated with recentlyacquired acreage in the Permian Basin. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including favorable
tax impacts and the net effect of small asset transactions.

Now on Slide 8, international upstream earnings were about $1.5 billion higher than the third quarter. Higher
liftings increased earnings by $295 million. Planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan and in the UK in the third quarter
were completed, and production from these fields returned to normal levels in the fourth quarter. Realizations
increased earnings by $95 million, reflecting a 2% improvement in average liquid realizations, [ph] which was
(08:19) in line with the increase in Brent prices. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects improved earnings
by about $220 million.
The fourth quarter had a loss of about $30 million, compared to a loss of $250 million in the third quarter. Asset
sale gains increased earnings by a net $830 million. Fourth quarter results included a gain of $1.4 billion from the
previously-announced asset exchange in Australia, while the third quarter contained a gain of $600 million
associated with the sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone project. The Other bar reflects a number of
unrelated items, including lower exploration expenses.
Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Production
increased 152,000 barrels per day between quarters. Recovery from the impacts of Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of
Mexico increased production by 23,000 barrels per day. Absence of planned turnaround activity, primarily in
Kazakhstan and the UK, increased production by 94,000 barrels a day. The base business bar includes higher cost
recovery volumes and production from newly-acquired acreage in the Permian Basin, partially offset by normal
field declines. Production from major capital projects increased in the fourth quarter by 7,000 barrels a day,
primarily driven by the ramp-up of Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico.
Slide 10 compares full-year 2012 net oil-equivalent production to that of 2011. Production decreased by 63,000
barrels per day in 2012. Frade remained shut-in for the year, reducing daily production by 29,000 barrels. The
base business and Other bar reflects normal field declines as well as the impact of smaller asset sales. Our base
decline rate for the year was approximately 4%, in line with prior guidance.
Incremental production from major capital projects contributed 85,000 barrels a day, driven by the ramp-up of
Platong II gas project in Thailand and Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the start-up of Usan in Nigeria.
Our original production guidance for 2012 was 2.68 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day. We fell short of that
guidance by 70,000 barrels per day, predominantly due to the shut-in of Frade and the delays experienced with
the start-up of Angola LNG.
Turning to Slide 11, U.S. downstream earnings decreased $125 million in the fourth quarter. Realized margins
decreased earnings by $90 million, driven mainly by weaker refining margins on both the Gulf and West Coast
due to lower demand and higher seasonal gasoline inventory levels. Improved marketing margins only partly
offset the decline in refining margins.
Volumes reduced earnings by $30 million, primarily due to the continued shutdown of the Richmond, California,
refinery crude unit. A return to normal operations at the Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery post-Hurricane Isaac
partly offset the decrease. Inventory effects represented a $95 million improvement in earnings between quarters,
largely reflecting favorable year-end LIFO effects. Operating expenses increased $100 million, largely due to
higher maintenance, transportation, and environmental-related expenses.
On Slide 12, international downstream earnings improved $361 million this quarter. Higher realized margins
benefited earnings by $60 million. Lower crack spreads in Asia were more than offset by improved marketing
margins and pricing lag effects for sales of naphtha and jet fuel in key markets. Inventory effects represented $145
million improvement in earnings between quarters, mostly reflecting the absence of negative inventory impacts
during the third quarter. Gains on asset sales, combined with the absence of charges associated with a portfolio
restructuring in Australia in the third quarter, improved earnings by $210 million. The Other bar reflects a
number of unrelated items, including unfavorable swing in foreign exchange impacts.
Slide 13 covers All Other. Fourth quarter net charges were $538 million, compared to a net $575 million charge in
the third quarter, so a decrease of $37 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted
in a $99 million benefit to earnings, while corporate costs were $62 million higher this quarter.
For the full year, this segment had net charges of $1.9 billion, which is higher than our quarterly guidance range of
$300 million to $400 million. Given the number of discrete items that impacted this segment in 2012, we are
upping our guidance range for 2013 to $400 million to $500 million per quarter to reflect several miscellaneous
items, including increased environmental remediation costs and higher corporate expenses.
With that I'd like to now turn it back over to John for a few thoughts on 2013.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Okay thanks, Pat. Let's turn to Slide 14. In early December we announced a $36.7 billion capital program for 2013.
Our capital program is well aligned with our long-stated strategy of investing in attractive projects that will deliver
volume growth and value growth for our shareholders. The program supports continued progress at several large
upstream projects under construction, notably our legacy LNG projects in Australia and our deepwater Gulf of
Mexico developments. Continued investments in our current project queue is expected to drive profitable growth
through the end of the decade.
We're also increasing our exploration activities, including the initial appraisal of recently-acquired acreage in the
Kurdistan region of Iraq, Suriname, Sierra Leone, and several international unconventional plays, among other
areas. Our downstream investments for 2013 are directed toward our premium base oil facility at our Pascagoula
refinery, expanded additives production in Singapore, and our projects which will enhance the reliability and
flexibility of our global refining system. Additional projects will be funded by affiliates in our refining and
chemicals joint venture.
Turning to Slide 15, our net production outlook for the year is 2.65 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day, an
increase of about 1.5% from 2012 levels. This is based on average Brent price of $112 per barrel, the same average
price as 2012, and does not assume OPEC curtailments, material security, or market impacts. Our full-year
estimate for 2013 is about on par with our fourth quarter 2012 production.
The start-up of Angola LNG, as well as increased production from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Thailand, and
Nigeria, are expected to roughly offset base business decline and normal turnaround activities later in the year.
Although we expect to restart production at the Frade field in Brazil, it will not contribute materially to this year's
net production. Base business decline is still expected to be about 4%.
Our 2017 production target remains intact, at 3.3 million barrels per day. In fact, over 90% of the volume
contributing to the target is either currently producing or under construction, with the remaining volume wellunderstood. We'll keep you posted through the year on developments and progress in both our upstream and
downstream businesses. We also plan to provide a great amount of additional detail at our upcoming security
analyst meeting in early March.

That concludes our prepared remarks. We now welcome your questions. We do have a full queue, so please limit
yourself to one question and a single follow-up, if necessary. We'll do our best to see that we get your questions
answered. Shawn, please open the lines for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead with your question.

Q

Good morning, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Hey, Evan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

John, I believe you guys hold over 950,000 acres in the Delaware Basin, inclusive of last year's asset acquisition,
and a larger position in the Permian, total, making Chevron one of the larger acreage-holders, yet running fewer
rigs than some of the peers. So how many unconventional rigs are you running? And maybe you could discuss
planned activity ramp in 2013 and whether or not there's any internal constraints for you, whether you're limited
at all on the people side to accelerating this NAV realization. And I have a second question, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. Well, we are ramping up rig activity. In fact, we're just looking at some of the material we're going to show
you for the SAM meeting that's coming up, and we'll give you actually some pretty good rig count data. And what
you'll see is we are ramping up rapidly in the Delaware Basin, as you would expect. We've got over – really over 20
in the Permian region that are running right now. We'll give you more specifics about the ramp-up that's headed
there. Activity in – a fewer number of rigs are running up in the Marcellus region, but that too has been gradually
ramping up as we – as you know, we're still drilling gas prospects there, as we have carry that we're working
through. I will be happy to give you a lot more detail with precision on the number of rigs. We are seeing volume
growth in both of these areas that are a part of the plan going forward. You had a follow-up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Yep, I just was curious, within that, if you saw any internal constraints. [ph] I mean you were (18:58) able to
organically to ramp those volumes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well we are. Having said that, I think the industry is very focused on building organizational capability, and we've
added a significant number of new people and added to our drilling training programs that we have in place, both
in the United States and overseas. And so organizational capability, we're not going to operate if we don't have
people that we think are trained and capable. And I think there are pressures on the industry, but when we plan to
ramp up, we only plan to ramp up if we have the right people.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Understood. And my second question was, John, I know it's one of your favorite topics as well as Pat, is the
Ecuador litigation. I noticed now there's been some positive movement there in the most recent quarter. We've
read the judge directly implicating himself in improper conduct as well as plaintiff, but also your legal
involvement is spreading across the globe now in Argentina and Brazilian courts as well as U.S. and Canada and
The Hague. So I was wondering if you could just provide any roadmap for activity in 2013 in these various theaters
of operation, and I – when the RICO case is set to commence. And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. That's a broad question. I'll try to do it succinctly.
First, your premise is correct. We continue to uncover evidence of quite profound fraud in the case, and you
mentioned that a judge that was actually involved in ghostwriting the opinions based on bribes he was receiving
from the plaintiff's lawyers has come forward and given a statement in U.S. courts and has provided corroborating
physical evidence to support his allegations that he ghostwrote the opinion for the plaintiff's lawyers.
So you now have a circumstance where we have, through videos, through sworn testimony, through e-mails and
other means, clear evidence that the plaintiff's lawyers have thoroughly corrupted the judicial process in Ecuador
and this is an invalid opinion. I think that's pretty well-known by you and others out there. I think the question is,
well, how do you bring this thing to an end? And I would say that we're moving forward in several areas.
The RICO case – the wheels of justice move at a certain pace. We've been moving our RICO case forward. It'll go
to trial in New York in October of this year. We're actively in the courts in The Hague, and we expect – there are a
series of rulings that will take place over time, but there are – we've won virtually every procedural ruling there
and expect that we will see some judge – there have already been some judgments that have been put out
indicating, for example, that the government of Ecuador should not do – that should do everything in their power
to prevent this false judgment from being enforced, which of course they've ignored. And so we do expect that
there will be possible rulings out of that panel as well, but there are multiple stages to those cases.
We've had multiple discovery proceedings in the U.S. The area that you're probably interested in is the – we
believe it's an illegal verdict, but the plaintiff's lawyers are taking it and trying to use that judgment for recoveries
in other countries. Our view has been that any country that honors rule of law will not uphold this verdict, and in
fact will throw it out. Having said that we have to defend ourselves, and so we're doing it in Canada, Argentina,
and Brazil.
You should know that these cases take time. There are a number of procedural steps that take place. And so first,
there are jurisdictional issues that are worked, and it takes a while, if you ever get through those hoops, to get to
the merits. And our view is that when there's been a fraud committed by the court that no government with a
functioning judiciary is going to uphold this. And the countries where these enforcement actions have been filed
we think ultimately will support rule of law. But we have to fight it every step of the way, and I can't put a timeline
on that. What I can tell you is we're not going to reward people that have committed crimes against us.

Q

Hi. Good morning.

A

Hey, Paul.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul B. Sankey
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

Again on the cash pile, I'm still perplexed by why it's so large subsequent to the Gorgon CapEx announcement.
John or Pat, could you just remind us again why we're holding so much cash on the balance sheet in this interest
rate environment? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. Sure, Paul. We've talked about the priorities for our cash, and I'll just – for the benefit of everyone on the
line, I'll just repeat them. Our uses of cash are geared toward paying and sustaining and growing the dividend,
funding the capital programs that are required to make our earnings and cash flow grow, keeping some capacity
on the balance sheet for the ups and downs in the commodity markets and changes that can take place in the
business, and finally, returning cash to shareholders through repurchases. And that's been our strategy for a long,
long time.
You're correct, we have more cash than debt on our balance sheet, but I think if you look at our capital program
that we've announced this year, where the cash portion of the C&E is about $33 billion, if you look at the cash that
we generated this year – and you can use your own estimate of what commodity prices and margins are going to
be – it'd be pretty easy to add, at the current rate of dividend and repurchases, some $12 billion in distributions,
and see that our net cash balances will come down this year based on a reasonable forecast.
I'll tell you that between now and the end of 2014, you should see our net cash less debt, that net number that we
talk about, will come down over time. I don't know exactly what commodity prices will be during that period, but
it will come down through a combination of significant capital spending, which we have underway this year and
next, dividends, and repurchases that we'll size to get our balance sheet back down to something with a little more
net debt on the balance sheet than we've had previously. We have had a conservative balance sheet. Prices have
been a little bit higher than we've expected. But we know that there are uncertainties out there, and we think that's
the best way to run our balances at this point.

Q

Thank you, John. John, you said you're relatively bullish on oil prices and you like the shape of your portfolio.
There is a U.S. oil revolution underway, and you do seem relatively underweight in that area, which is, after all,
your own backyard. What's your appetite to step up your exposure to U.S. oil? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. Well, we do – we are investing in a big way in the United States, of course offshore with our developments at
Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot and the exploration program that we have in the Gulf of Mexico. I think you're
probably referring to some of the onshore activity. And again, we've had a longstanding position in California that
produces oil. We've had a mature business and a lot of acreage in West Texas. And then we've recently added to
that with the acquisition that we – where we picked up some acreage in New Mexico from Chesapeake.
Our unconventional production, we told you last year that our unconventional production around the world will
be 175,000 barrels a day by 2017, that it was – a not insignificant portion of the increase in our production
between now and 2017 would be in the unconventional area, and a lot of that's in the United States. And I think
what you'll see when we come back for the SAM presentation in a month or so is that number will be higher, and it
will be a function of the ramp-up of activity in the Permian area as well as some successes that we expect to see in
the Marcellus and in the Utica.
So I'll tell you, we tend to be returns-focused when we make investments. And I'll tell you, right now, a lot of what
we see, a lot of transactions come across our desk, but we take on opportunities where we think on a full-cycle
basis, including the acquisition costs, we can generate solid returns. And right now, there are assets that are
selling that we think are very pricey. Now, we feel very good about the acquisition of acreage from Chesapeake.
That was a complex transaction. We think we negotiated a good deal there. We feel particularly good – although
it's not oil, we feel particularly good about the transaction in Canada. It's an enormous resource that we've picked
up that ultimately will produce LNG for export that will be at oil-linked pricing. And so we feel pretty good about
the way we've added to our portfolio, given all the opportunities that we have around the world.

Q

Sure. Conceptually, would you prefer the Bakken or the Permian?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, I'd prefer an area where we can make a good return, being very honest. We don't have a position in the
Bakken. I think I've said before that if I could wind back the clock and see that well, it'd be nice to have a position.
But it's very pricey right now., and to just pour a bunch of capital in there and enter that fray, I don't know that we
could make full-cycle economics look very good.

Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel of Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason D. Gammel
Analyst, Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.

Q

Thanks very much. I just had a couple questions on LNG, if I could, please. First of all, revisions for the Gorgon
budget are now out in the marketplace, and John, I just wanted to – or Pat, just ask what potentially you've
learned from the Gorgon process that you'll be able to apply to Wheatstone to potentially keep the cost of that
projects more in line with the original budget.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, fair question. If you look at the Gorgon project, when we went to FID back in 2009, oil prices were in the
$60s. The Australian dollar was, I think, $0.86 or so. And we don't hedge foreign exchange exposure because we
think the Australian dollar is pretty well hedged to commodity prices, and that actually has proven to be accurate.
So part of the increase that you saw in cost was from foreign exchange – in fact, about a third of the cost increase.
The areas where we had some challenges were really in the area of logistics, and that was fairly unique to Barrow
Island, where some of the quantities of materials proved to be larger than expected, and the logistics – there's a
large fleet of vessels moving goods and materials onto Barrow Island. And we have learned from that.
So I think there – in terms of things that triggered the cost increases at Gorgon, I think we've learned well about
the logistics. But Wheatstone is an onshore project. It's not on Barrow Island. So I think the circumstances are just
a little bit different. Some of the learnings that are key to us are that you better get your infrastructure in order.
So, for example, we're working very hard right now on simple things like beds and roads and infrastructure, and
that is going quite well at Wheatstone. At times we were impacted by weather as we were constructing the beds
and other facilities and infrastructure in the early days of Gorgon. There were a number of cyclones that went
through the area, and that impacted us. So we know that infrastructure is critical path, and we're working very
hard there.
Now, there are a number of other learnings and synergies, if you will, that will come from the people and
procurement and other activity on Gorgon that of course will be applied to Wheatstone. So we're doing our best to
learn from Gorgon and other projects as we move forward. Now, remember, Wheatstone went to FID at sort of
parity with the Australian dollar, so I don't expect a material impact from foreign exchange as we've seen in
Gorgon today.

Q

Sure. And, John, if I could just follow up, please, on the comment that you made about oil-linked pricing for the
Kitimat project, that might be considered somewhat of a controversial remark in that some buyers are trying to
push away from oil price linkage. Can you just comment on what you're seeing in your conversations with buyers
about the ability to sustain that oil linkage?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, as soon as it was announced that we were coming into that project, our phones started ringing. So buyers –
we're a credible buyer in the marketplace, and I think buyers throughout Asia – Japan, Korea, et cetera – are very
interested in Chevron and interested in the project. I'm going to show you a little bit of information at the SAM
coming up in a month or so, because there's a lot of talk about the different pricing for LNG, and there's always a
balance between supply and demand, and what we see is continuing growth in demand. There's a lot of gas out
there, but pulling these projects together and getting them on line, getting them on line in time to meet that
demand is a different matter.
And I can tell you that it takes a large capital commitment, and most companies in the world aren't going to make
that commitment without having pricing that gives them a fair return. And that pricing is going to need to be
something close to oil parity, or the projects won't get built. And so we'll talk more about that. I know that there
are different contract negotiations going on in the industry, but – and talk of S curves and things of that sort, but
so far we've been able to keep our contracts on an oil-linked basis and have expectations that we'll have strong
pricing going forward, or, frankly, these projects won't go. So that's the best way I can answer that.

Q

On the downstream side, could you give us an update on the Richmond refinery and when it will return to full
operation, and what regulatory approvals and permits are required to bring all the units back up and running?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. We had the fire that was back in August. Since that time we've been going through the regulatory reviews, as
you would expect, and going through the repairs that have been necessary. And we're nearing the end of that
repair work, and we really have a couple of steps that are left. One is an order prohibiting use, which has to be
lifted by Cal/OSHA. And the second is our own sort of pre-start safety reviews that would be normal and
customary to bring the crude unit back up. So we're really targeting first quarter, and I have no reason to think it
will be other than that at this time. The repair work is going well. And it's been arduous getting permits and going
through the process here in Richmond, but we're working through that and expect that we'll be ready to go here in
the first quarter.

Q

Faisel H. Khan
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)

Okay great. Thanks. And just a quick question on the asset sale gain in downstream, could you just confirm that
the $210 million change quarter-over-quarter is also pretty close to the absolute asset sale gain in the quarter?

Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Well actually, no. I mean we did have a third quarter – there was the asset transaction, a negative impact
associated with the Australia restructuring. So it's – the variance is what we were talking about. It's a relatively
small amount that you're talking about altogether.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Great, excellent. Thank you. [inaudible] (36:40 – 36:42) something over here. So John, the question was on the
timing of Kitimat, and the FEED work that Apache has already done. What do you expect happens now to the
timeline of that project? And I do have a follow up, if you can hear me. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well you know what? I better wait till we close the transaction before I comment. Apache has been doing –
Apache and partners have been doing the work thus far, and we hope to close the transaction soon, and we'll
become the operator at the plant and pick up where they've left off. And they have done quite a bit of work.
But it's really – it's too early for me to talk about the specifics because, frankly, we're not yet in the project per se.
So give us a pass for now, and after we close the transaction and can follow up on the due diligence work that
we've done and really look more closely, we'll give you a better idea of both cost and schedule in due course here.

Q

Great. Thanks. So my follow-up is, going back to our lunch in December, you'd mentioned some concern or maybe
some issues around the tax rate here in Nigeria. Could you give us an update as to where you see that currently
and how it may or may not impact to the development? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah I wish I could give you an update, but there's been a petroleum bill in progress in Nigeria for several years
now, and frankly, I don't have any particular update on it right now.
A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Yeah I was just going to say, the bill is currently in the National Assembly, and as John says, it's been under review
for a long period of time, and we really can't say much more about which way we think this will go. We've been on
record as saying that as it's constructed, it's not an incentive for further investment, particularly deepwater.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Doug Leggate

[inaudible] (38:36 – 38:37) is pretty far along, though. I would assume that wouldn't be affected?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

I'm not going to speculate on where it may wind up. We and others have expressed our view that the bill, the
ultimate bill that's put into law needs to offer incentive, or they'll see reduced activity. Frankly right now the
uncertainty is resulting in reduced activity, so they do need to come to resolution, but I'm not going to predict how
or when that's going to happen.

Q

John, maybe as a newbie, I have an oddball question. Over the last 10 years, I think a lot of people, both in the
industry and the host government, believe the resources become more scarce. Easy oil has already been tapped,
and so they've been pushing tougher and tougher terms. With the last several years of the newfound opportunity
set in North America, and quite frankly, that I think their budget costs in the host government has continued to go
up. So have you seen a bit of a change in your negotiation or in your dialogue with the host government that they
become a bit more accommodative or that the balance of power start to shifting more back into a neutral zone?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Fair question, Paul. I can't say that I've seen a relaxation in terms. What I will say is that it's a competitive market
out there, and countries that put forward terms and conditions that don't allow us to make a fair return, we look
elsewhere. The reality is we have a long queue of opportunities. It's as good as it's ever been since I've been in the
company. And we have more opportunities coming at us every day at all phases of development, from exploration
all the way up through discovered resources and other opportunities. And so we can be a little bit choosey. And
capital does move across the globe and goes to where the returns are.
I'm not going to single out specific countries, but I think you know well that there are a number of countries where
activity has ground to a halt, and it's ground to a halt because investors do have choices, and they're not going to
go where they don't have the certainty of the returns, a fiscal environment and other conditions necessary to
invest. So it is a competitive world, and I will say that some host governments are acutely aware of what's
happening in the U.S. And I know there is some nervousness in that regard, but I can't say that I've seen a
wholesale change in ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Can I ask as a follow-up that in the last, say, 10 years that in sometimes that we have seen some foolish behavior
from some of your competitors in rushing in some projects and setting really bad terms; in your discussion and
when you chat with your peer or what you can see in your partner, have you seen the behavior change that the
people now that believe they have better opportunity set than, say, in the past so that they are not going to be as
maybe that accepting of those unreasonable terms as likely as in the past?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Because in a commodity business, sometimes unfortunately that you are only as good as your [ph] next numbers
guy (42:16).

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, I'm not going to comment on our competitors. What I'll say is, for us, is we have to see the right fiscal terms
in order for us to invest. One of the areas we've talked about before that was, frankly, disappointing to me in many
ways because we worked very hard was in Iraq, where, going way back to 2003, we had been providing technical
support and training, and we had hoped that there'd be an opportunity to enter southern Iraq. And when push
came to shove in those bid rounds, we just didn't see that the opportunity measured up.
We're always value-focused in what we do. We're not barrel-focused per se. Those are great resources, but we
didn't see an opportunity to make money. So we politely passed on bidding and moved on to other opportunities. I
can't speak for others, but that's the calculus we go through. We want to help nations grow and develop their
resources, but we have to get a fair return in doing so. And I think host governments are getting better at
recognizing that. I assume our partners have similar criteria. They may come to different judgments on these
things, but that's what we're all trying to do.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Iain S. Reid
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Hi, John, couple of questions, please. Firstly, I'm a little surprised you said that there's going to be minimal
production from Angola LNG this year. Is there still issues with that plant that are going to delay it into, say,
second half of the year? Or maybe you could just expand a little bit on what the situation is there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

I hope I said that there will be minimal production from Frade this year. Frade, we shut down on a precautionary
basis early in 2012, and we're working closely with the regulatory authorities to restart production, but I won't
give you an estimated date until we can complete the discussions to settle some of the litigation that's involved
there. And the discussions have been good. Angola LNG is different. We do expect Angola LNG to start up in the
second quarter, so we do have a partial year of production, and in fact, that's the single-largest contributor. If you
look at our major capital project wedge on production for 2013, Angola LNG is the largest single project. It'll start
up in the second quarter and ramp up over the course of the year. At full capacity, after full ramp-up, Angola LNG
contributes about 60,000 barrels a day, so it's significant. But there will be a ramp-up that will happen over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Iain S. Reid
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q
Okay. My follow-up is on your 2017 production. You said that you had 90% of the volumes ongoing in order to
meet that. What's the extra 10%? And I'm just wondering, you've still got the fairly low price assumption on that.
Do you want to give us any sort of sensitivity of what it would be at, say, current prices?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. Yeah, we categorize our projects into several different categories. We have producing assets today, so we
have assets that are on line today, and there's a natural decline to those. But a significant number of those are
producing today and will be on line – and still be on line in 2017. We have projects that are under construction,
projects like Jack/St. Malo in the Gulf of Mexico. That will be on production and ramped up and will contribute,
but it's not contributing today. So that's a project that's under construction. We also have projects that are in
FEED, or front-end engineering and design. And then we have – that will come to a final investment decision,
investments will be made, and they will start up. And then we have other, smaller capital projects that have a
shorter cycle time to them.
So the remaining 10% are typically shorter cycle-time projects that we know are coming or projects that have not
yet – are not yet under construction. An example of some of the projects that will ramp up are some of the very
activities in the Permian and elsewhere in the United States, smaller projects in Thailand and Indonesia, places
like that. So we have good knowledge of what's in there. What we're saying is the project itself may not be under
construction right now on that remaining 10%. We're going to give you a heck of a lot of detail on all of this
information as we get up to the SAM meeting. I'll just say that we have greater certainty and knowledge and
confidence today than we did a year ago on that 2017 target. We have work to do, but we know where the barrels
are coming from.

Q

So you don't need Tengiz Future Growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Actually not, actually not. When we first gave you our target for 2017, there was some contribution from the
Future Growth Project. We've been working with the government and our partners on FGP. In fact, I was in
Kazakhstan late last year, and the president was very supportive of the project and wanted us to move it forward
expeditiously. It does have a long lead time to it. We've had to work through issues with our partners. We've done
that, and we expect that start-up will be in 2018. So we've been able to replace the barrels that we had previously
earmarked for 2017 from Tengiz with other opportunities, and of course that means that we will have growth
beyond 2017 from that very significant project, which only adds to the profile we've talked about.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

And we'll talk more about some of the projects that will contribute. And we – I don't think we've made a secret of
the Tengiz – the next project at Tengiz is a 250,000 to 300,000 barrel-a-day gross project, and we have about half
of that. So it's a significant contributor, but there are other changes that have taken place in the portfolio. There
are other opportunities as well. But essentially, as that project moved out just a little bit, we've replaced it with
unconventional and other opportunities.

Q

Edward G. Westlake

Thanks for the call so far. Just coming back to the Gulf of Mexico, obviously that's still an area with a lot of spend
going on. Any update on projects on time, on budget?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah actually, I just had a review recently, and both Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot are on schedule for start-up next
year. They're both going well. They're both over 50% complete. Big Foot's some two-thirds of the way along.
Jack/St. Malo is close to 60% along. We've got development drilling that's taking place, a couple rigs that are
working Jack/St. Malo now. So the progress is good. We'll give you a little more color around that next month at
the SAM meeting, but the progress is good.
2014 will be a good year for us production-wise. We'll have – in addition to those projects coming on during the
year, we'll have a full year of activity from Angola LNG, we'll have a substantial contribution from Papa Terra,
Escravos gas-to-liquid, and others. So we expect 2014 will be a pretty good year and pretty consistent with what
we've talked to you about before, where on this 2017 pathway, the growth would be back-end loaded, and 2014 is
when you'll start to see most of that come to pass.

And then just switching to shale, I mean you mentioned 175,000 barrels-a-day contribution to 2017. You may not

Duvernay, and the liquid-rich Utica?

Q

John, previously you mentioned the value of integration, given that you never really know where the rents are
going to be in the oil and gas business. Given the growing U.S. volumes, your participation in the unconventional
and Gulf of Mexico, some of these volumes that may trade at a discount to global world prices, does it make sense
at this point to maybe reevaluate your U.S. refining position and particularly get involved in maybe some of these
areas in the U.S., whether it be the Mid-Con or the Gulf Coast, that may see long-term benefits from this? Or is the
focus still more just on the chemicals side for your downstream?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah if you're saying are we thinking about buying a refinery, I would tell you that's not something that we're
looking to do. Our involvement really is along the lines you describe, where we do have low-cost liquids and our
terrific position with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company allows us to take advantage of that, both for existing
assets and this expansion project that the Chemical Company has discussed. So that's the primary way that we'll
take advantage of it.
Now I will say that we've got two refineries that do take advantage of low-cost feedstock. We have a refinery at Salt
Lake. We have a refinery at Burnaby in British Columbia. And those two refineries take advantage of low-cost
feedstocks. And we're always looking for ways to try to get lower-cost feedstocks into our West Coast and
Pascagoula refineries.
That's a little tougher. We've moved a little bit there, but it's a longer haul, so it's not clear that we'll be able to take
advantage of it in that way. But we've got quite a bit of effort really – we're pretty full-up on what we think are
some good investments in the upstream end of the business. Over time I think these markets will equalize, and so
making investments that aren't quite compatible with our strategy in the downstream to take advantage of what
we think will be a short-term phenomenon really isn't something we're looking to do.

Q

Okay thanks. And then you mentioned some of the premium that was on unconventional opportunities here in the
U.S., particularly in the Bakken. Do you see more value maybe internationally, where the market's a little bit less
developed and maybe where you can apply a bit more expertise and have a bit more value-add on the
unconventional side? Or if you look internationally as well, do you see a bit more opportunity maybe where –
areas you're not currently involved, where you may be able to leverage your deepwater expertise, like in the Arctic
or in East Africa or maybe even in Russia?

A
Yeah our commercial philosophy is to go in where we can bring technology or something unique. We favor early,
low-cost entries where we can add value over time through the application of our technology or know-how. When
it gets down to a pure bidding war with a lot of different players, in the U.S. there's a lot of money that's looking
for opportunities, and if it's not a particularly difficult entry for a party, it means there'll be a lot of bidders and
prices get bid up. So while the resources are very good and well understood in the U.S., and in many cases are
quite prolific, we're focused on the kind of returns we can get.
And so we have made selective entries in the U.S. We feel good about those entries. Done well in Canada, and
we've picked up some acreage overseas, notably in half a dozen countries in Central Europe – we have a
preliminary agreement in South Africa – Argentina, China, et cetera. Those are more exploration plays and are
early-stage entries. They don't represent a significant capital commitments, but the upside if they're successful will
be significant. We think we'll be able to add value.
Similarly, in more conventional exploration, there are parties that come to us, because of our knowledge and
expertise in deepwater that want an experienced partner, and we're able to typically negotiate arrangements that
are better than just an open bidding. In some cases we work directly with the government on awards, and in other
cases we'll work with smaller companies that may have accumulated acreage over time. And that's why you've seen
we've added acreage in Sierra Leone, Suriname, and other locations.

Q

Yeah, hi, just two quick ones for you, John. You mentioned at the beginning that you had signed new LNG
contracts in Australia. Are those incremental to what was discussed last September on the tour?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

No, I don't think we have anything new to talk about on the contracts. We're over 80% placed on Wheatstone and
in the mid-60%s on Gorgon.

So, John, we were just commenting that that was an accomplishment for the year, for 2012.

Q

Okay. I just wanted to make sure I didn't misunderstand. Obviously, I did. Next one, on the Gulf of Mexico, you
have to do more BOP testing today. How has that kind of changed your development costs, given the new
regulations in the Gulf? And that's it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. Well, several things have changed in the Gulf of Mexico for us. If you really look at what's happened, the
regulatory environment of course is – obviously, there's a great deal of attention to the regulatory environment. So
the permitting process itself takes time. The number of inspections that takes place is significant. There are extra
casing strings that can be required at times, added BOP inspections, added costs for being a part of the Marine
Wall Containment Company, et cetera. So – plus other cost pressures that you're seeing in the business. So we
have seen some cost increases. It's – in addition to that, rig rates. So over the past several years, it's not unusual to
say a 20% to 25% increase in costs have been seen by the industry, and that's just the reality of doing business
today. Of course, we've got over $100 oil too.

Operator: Our final question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pavel Molchanov

Q

Thanks for taking my question. On the Kitimat project, just taking a step back, as one of the top LNG producers,
particularly when Gorgon and Wheatstone start up, are you worried that with 30 U.S. and Canadian LNG export
plants in some stage of development, there could be kind of a delinking of LNG and crude in Asia-Pacific?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, I think that's been speculated about. Our view is that there are always a queue of projects that are discussed,
and if you look closely at what's discussed versus what actually gets built, there's a difference between the two.

And I said earlier on the call that I don't think that you'll see what I would call speculative development of LNG
sites without some certainty around contracts and sales prices. And my view is it's going to take substantial prices
to underpin developments of these tens of billions of dollars in spending that's going to be required. And
therefore, some projects will go and some will not. We think that we have a leg up in terms of the relationships we
have, the credibility we have, our ability to construct facilities, in our discussions with the buyers.
Next month at the SAM meeting, I'll show you a little bit of information about our view of both supply and
demand for worldwide LNG. And what we see is continued growth in demand, and supply that tends to
continually get pushed out, because the lead time on these projects is long. It's now at the point that it's pretty
close to six years. And so you can see these projects coming, and there may be announcements made, but until you
see FID, until you see construction happen, you have to be somewhat circumspect about which projects will
actually contribute to supply.

I think that's it. I appreciate the good question. That concludes our remarks. Let me say I just appreciate
everyone's participation in today's call. I have given several plugs for our full Security Analyst Meeting that we're
going to have in March. We'll look forward to seeing you there. Thank you all very much. Shawn?
