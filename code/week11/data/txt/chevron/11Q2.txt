Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Hey, thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call
with me today are George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President of Upstream and Gas, and
Jeanette Ourada, General Manager, Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating
results for the second quarter of 2011. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were $7.7
billion or $3.85 per diluted share. Comparing the second quarter 2011 to the same quarter a year earlier, our
earnings were up 43%. Upstream benefited from higher crude oil prices, and downstream benefited from
improved margins. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was over 19%. Our debt ratio at the end
of June was 9.1%. In the second quarter, we had share repurchases of $1 billion. Effective for the third quarter,
and reflecting the strength in crude prices and of our current near-term outlook, we are increasing the upper end
of our target range on share repurchases to $2 billion. In the third quarter, we expect share repurchases of $1.25
billion.
Turning to Slide 4, cash generated from operations was nearly $11 billion during the second quarter. This is a new
record for the company, topping last quarter's performance. Year to date, we have used this strong cash flow in a
manner completely consistent with our established financial priorities. We raised the dividend in the second
quarter by 8%. We've funded a strong capital program and made some modest acquisitions. Both the organic and
the inorganic components of these outlays are poised to earn attractive returns and drive future growth for the
company. We've also continued to strengthen our balance sheet, and we've returned surplus cash to our
shareholders in the form of share buybacks. At quarter end, our cash balances totaled nearly $18 billion. This puts
us in a net cash position of 6.5 billion.
Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.

General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Pat.
Turning to Slide 5. I'll compare results of the second quarter 2011 with the first quarter 2011. As a reminder, our
earnings release compares second quarter 2011 with the same quarter a year ago. Second quarter earnings were
$7.7 billion. $1.5 billion higher than the first quarter.
Starting on the left side of the chart, upstream earnings were up $894 million, driven by higher crude oil
realizations. Downstream results increased $422 million between quarters, benefiting from improved margins.
The variance in the Other bar reflects a favorable swing in corporate tax items and lower corporate charges.
On Slide 6, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $501 million higher than the first quarter's
results. Combined crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $420 million. U.S. crude
realizations increased 17% between consecutive quarters, well above the 8% increase in the average spot price of
West Texas Intermediate. As a reminder, our U.S. crude realizations are tied presumably to Mars, Louisiana light
sweet, and San Joaquin Valley heavy crudes, all of which traded at premiums to WTI during the second quarter.
Natural gas realizations also improved, increasing 8% between quarters, slightly higher than the 5% increase in
the average Henry Hub bid week. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $55 million between periods,
reflecting higher costs related to maintenance activities across multiple assets, including more workovers. The
higher expenses also reflect a full quarter of operations for our new Marcellus assets. The Other bar is comprised
of a number of unrelated items, including gains on several small asset sales and higher volumes due to an
additional day between quarters.
Turning to Slide 7, international upstream earnings were up $393 million compared with the first quarter. Higher
oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $875 million. Average liquids realizations increased 12%, in
line with the increase in average Brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations contributed $70 million of the
variance, improving 9% between quarters. This improvement was driven by price increases in our primary Asian
gas markets, which have crude-linked pricing components.

Higher operating expense decreased earnings $205 million. The increase was spread across multiple geographic
areas and included higher environmental remediation expense and higher maintenance and fuel cost. You'll recall
that last year, on our third quarter call, we highlighted our expectation of a 2011 full-year increase in reported
operating expense of approximately $1 billion due to a new Indonesian agreement where we sell oil and purchase
natural gas. Previously, we handled this through a volume exchange. There is no bottom-line earnings impact, and
no impact on production. Year to date, our reported operating expense number is up $1.3 billion. Of that, $900
million is from the new Indonesian agreement. At current year-to-date prices, we would expect the full-year
impact to be approximately $1.8 billion.
Moving to the next bar, higher exploration expense reduced earnings by $140 million, primarily due to a well
write-off in the UK and higher G&G cost associated with increased exploration activity. The Other bar reflects a
number of items, including unfavorable tax effects and higher DD&A, partially offset by a favorable swing in
foreign exchange and higher liftings. The second quarter had a foreign exchange gain of about $30 million
compared to a loss of about $115 million in the first quarter. These foreign exchange effects have minimal impact
on cash. They are primarily balance sheet translation effects.
Moving to Slide 8. summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production.
Production decreased 66,000 barrels per day between quarters. Higher prices reduced volumes under production
sharing and variable royalty contracts during the second quarter, decreasing production about 8,000 barrels per
day. As a reminder, last quarter we began using Brent to calculate a price effect rate, as it is more closely tied to
our international realizations. Average Brent spot prices increased about $12 per barrel between quarters, which
resulted in about a 700-barrel-per-day volume reduction for each dollar increase in Brent. Recall that over a range
of prices, this rate is not linear. As prices rise, the production impact per dollar change in Brent decreases.
Moving to the next bar, base business production decreased 66,000 barrels per day, largely driven by
maintenance activity in Kazakhstan, Thailand, and the Gulf of Mexico and lower cost recovery in Trinidad. This
bar also reflects a positive impact from a full quarter of Marcellus production and absence of first quarter's
weather impacts. Incremental production from major capital projects benefited second quarter production by
8,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by less downtime in Canada and continued ramp-ups at Perdido in the
Gulf of Mexico and Tombua-Landana in Angola. George will discuss our current-year production outlook in a few
minutes.
Turning to Slide 9. U.S. downstream earnings improved $122 million in the second quarter. Indicator margins
strengthened between quarters, increasing earnings by $215 million. Refining and marketing margins for both the
Gulf Coast and West Coast improved relative to last quarter, benefiting from higher seasonal demand for gasoline.
Refined product margins also showed some strength early in the quarter, as supplies in some areas were affected
by refinery maintenance. However, both these factors lessened and margins generally slipped as the quarter
progressed. Operating expenses reduced earnings by $35 million, driven mainly by higher third-party credit card
fees and transportation costs. The Other bar consists of several unrelated items, including lower volumes, partly
offset by improved chemicals and trading results.
On Slide 10, international downstream earnings were also higher this quarter, increasing $300 million from first
quarter's results. Refining and marketing margins rose in all key regions, benefiting earnings by $165 million.
Timing effects represented a $155 million positive earnings variance between quarters. First quarter had a
negative $195 million impact, with a smaller impact of negative $40 million in the second quarter. The primary
driver was favorable mark-to-market effects on derivatives tied to underlying physical positions. Negative foreign
currency effects impacted earnings by $55 million. Second quarter's foreign exchange loss was about $95 million,
compared to the first quarter loss of $40 million. The Other bar includes a number of unrelated items, including
improved trading and chemical results, partly offset by lower volumes.

Slide 11 covers all other. Second quarter net charges were $183 million, compared to a net $388 million charge in
the first quarter; a decrease of $205 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in
a $151 million benefit to earnings. Corporate charges were $54 million lower in the second quarter. Year to date,
corporate charges were $571 million. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for
net charges in the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward.
George is now going to provide an update on our upstream operations. George?

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

Thank you, Jeanette. It's good to be back to discuss upstream performance and our production outlook for the
remainder of the year.
I'd like to begin by looking at our second quarter competitive position on earnings markets. Please turn to Slide
13. In the second quarter, upstream margins were approximately $29 per barrel, another excellent quarter,
reinforcing the strength of our oil-weighted portfolio and the high quality of our assets. Based on competitor
results disclosed this week, we continue to lead our peers in this key metric. In the second quarter, we are nearly
$8 per barrel ahead of our nearest competitor and over $10 per barrel higher than the peer group average. In
addition, we have now held the top position for eight consecutive quarters. As you would expect, I'm very pleased
with our leading position and our ability to sustain this performance over the past two years.
While we are discussing margins, I'd like to make a brief comment on operating expense. Excluding fuel, our yearto-date OpEx is very consistent with our recent historical performance. This is a positive indicator for maintaining
our peer-leading margins. Through the first half of the year, our return on capital employed was 32%. We've been
making smart investment decisions for a long period of time, and we've now achieved the leading position in our
peer group. We continue to deliver superior financial performance and to lead our competition on key operational
and financial metrics.
Now I'll turn to production. Please turn to Slide 14. Our first-half production averaged 2.73 million barrels a day –
at the Brent price of $111 per barrel. Based on the year-to-date results and a Brent price of $111 per barrel, our
revised full-year production outlook is 2.73 million barrels per day. Adjusted to a $79 per barrel, this equates to
2.76 million barrels per day, a reduction from our original outlook of 30,000 barrels per day.
This revised outlook is a result of two primary drivers: First, a recent incident in Thailand caused a key third-party
gas pipeline to be shut down. And second, a slower-than-planned wrap-up of the Perdido project in the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico. The full-year production impact of these two items is about 30,000 barrels per day, and they are
approximately split between the two. Outside these items, our major capital projects in total are performing as
planned. Agbami in Nigeria, SGI/SGP in Kazakhstan, and Frade in Brazil continue to deliver excellent results. Our
base business performance has continued to be strong, offsetting the impacts of weather challenges earlier in the
year. We have strong momentum entering the second half of the year, and we remain well positioned to deliver
long-term growth.
Now turning to Slide 15. We first showed you this slide last year. Through 2014, we forecast production to grow by
approximately 1% per year. And starting in 2014, as our Australian LNG investments come online and begin to
ramp up toward full capacity, this growth rate is expected to increase to between 4% and 5%. Our long-term
outlook remains unchanged. With the strength and scale of these projects and the depth of our portfolio, we
expect our production to grow to 3.3 million barrels per day by 2017. Our growth projects are on track. We're
advancing the queue. We're reaching critical milestones and are well placed to deliver consistent growth and
performance over the long term.
Now let's review our 2011 exploration plans on Slide 16. We have an active year of exploration. We plan to invest
over $2 billion, which includes the drilling of about 60 wells. We've returned to work in the Gulf of Mexico. We
currently have three rigs drilling in the deepwater: an appraisal well at Buckskin, an exploration well at Moccasin,
and a development well on the Tahiti 2 project. There is no doubt this past year has been a challenge for the Gulf
of Mexico. I'm pleased with the recent progress we've made, which is a testament to the hard work of many people
to get both Chevron and the industry back to work.
In addition to our deepwater activity, we're also drilling ahead at Bear's Hump. This is a key test of the ultra-deep
Wilcox gas play on the Gulf of Mexico shelf. This well is also noteworthy, as we're drilling it from an onshore
location. We think there's still a lot of potential in the Gulf, and it's not all located in the deepwater. Chevron is
well positioned in the Lower Tertiary play, both in the deepwater and on the shelf.
In Australia, we have two more exploration wells planned this year. One of them is an offset to the Acme discovery
we announced last year. We've also been active in acquiring additional acreage, picking up two new leases near
Barrow Island. The Carnarvon Basin is a key focus area for Chevron, with 10 discoveries over the last 18 months.
We have an aggressive exploration program planned to underpin future expansions at Gorgon and Wheatstone.
In Brazil, we plan to drill a well later this year in the pre-salt section beneath our Frade Field. If successful, we'll be
in a great position to take advantage of our existing production facilities. We also have some exciting prospects in
Liberia, China, Poland, and Canada that we've discussed before. We plan to start drilling in all of these areas later
this year.
Next, on Slide 17, I'll highlight some of our recent activities in the Marcellus shale. In February of this year, we
closed on the acquisition of Atlas Energy and are currently working to complete the integration of these assets into
our North America business. In May, we announced the acquisition of assets from Chief Oil & Gas and in Tug Hill.
Through these transactions, we added another 228,000 net acres of high-quality Marcellus shale to our existing
footprint. Largely focused in Southwestern Pennsylvania, the acreage includes over 30,000 acres of rich gas
Marcellus in Marshall County, West Virginia. This expansion of our shale gas portfolio gives us additional highquality resources, as well as strong synergies with existing operations. The acquired assets currently include 22
wells that are on production and an additional 34 wells waiting on completion or pipeline hookup. Combined with
Atlas, this acreage is estimated to hold 14 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources and is aligned with our
strategy to pursue opportunities with long-term organic growth potential.
Next, let's review progress in other key projects on the next slide. Expansion of the Caspian Pipeline has begun.
This project will increase capacity to 1.4 million barrels per day from a current level of 730,000 barrels per day
and is a critical step forward in enabling a further expansion of our Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan. The project will be
implemented in three phases, with capacity increasing progressively from the period of 2012 to 2015.
At Gorgon, we continue to make good progress on our critical path items, and they remain on track. We've begun
horizontal directional drilling for pipeline installation, and we also started development drilling operations.
Gorgon is presently 25% complete. At Wheatstone, we've received a – conditional environmental approvals and
are selectively appealing certain conditions. In addition, we announced earlier this week that we have executed
LNG sales and purchase agreements with Tokyo Electric for delivery of up to 3.1 million tons per annum of
offtake. This is a significant milestone as we work toward a final investment decision in the second half of 2011.

In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we're making progress at Jack/St. Malo, where we've cut first steel on the hull
and the topsides.
And at Angola LNG, we're beginning to commission the utility systems and plan to start up subsequent process
units throughout the rest of 2011. We're making good progress here and expect first production early next year.
In addition, we've acquired more than 1 million acres of shale gas leasehold in Bulgaria. This continues to grow
our position in Eastern Europe. Around the world, we have now acquired nearly 5 million net acres of shale gas
assets since late 2010.
In summary, we've had a great quarter and a great first half of the year and are on track to deliver long-term
growth. With that, I'd like to now to turn it back to Pat.

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay, thank you, George.
Turning now to Slide 19. I'd like to close out our prepared remarks with some highlights of Chevron's strategic
progress during the quarter. George just gave you an update on recent progress in our upstream process. We are
back to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, and we continue to execute our major capital projects and to add new
resource opportunities to our portfolio. In downstream we received government approval to proceed with the sale
of our refining and marketing assets in Ireland and the UK, including the Pembroke refinery. We expect to close
that stale next week. We are on track and progressing well with our downstream restructuring plans. During the
quarter, we completed several small asset sales in three Central American countries, as well as in China and North
America.
And finally, I'd like to make a few comments about the current discussions in Washington. Chevron is proud to be
a healthy American company. We believe healthy companies are the cure for a sick economy. In the U.S., Chevron
directly employs nearly 25,000 people with good jobs and good salaries. Indirectly, we support another 150,000
jobs. We plan to invest over $7 billion in the U.S. this year to expand energy supplies, which creates jobs and
generates revenue for federal, state, and local treasuries. We're proud to be part of an industry that is
indispensible to economic growth and competitiveness. We want the opportunity to compete on a level playing
field, both here at home and around the globe. And we look forward to working constructively under stable,
predictable fiscal and regulatory policies to build a shared prosperity for America and for our shareholders.
So that concludes our prepared remarks. We now welcome your questions. And Sean, I'd ask that you open the
line up. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ed G. Westlake
Research Analyst, Credit Suisse (United States)

Q

Congratulations on the results and the cash generation. Maybe a first one on CapEx. $7.8 billion, I guess, includes
the Marcellus acquisitions. Can you talk about maybe where you see underlying CapEx for the year against your
plans, and acquisition CapEx as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, it's a question, Ed. Thanks very much. You noted exactly correctly that the uptick we had in the second
quarter did relate to some coring up of our Marcellus properties. That wasn't a planned item, but we saw the
opportunity and took advantage of it. We don't anticipate being substantially different than where we set as a
target, $26 billion. We're halfway through the year. We're about 52% spent, and that looks to be in the reasonable
range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ed G. Westlake
Research Analyst, Credit Suisse (United States)

Q

Okay, thank you. And then maybe a question for George. There've been some high-profile cost overruns in
Australia; we all know that. You're taking a modular approach to Gorgon, and I think you used the same modular
approach on your SGI/SGP successful project in Kazakhstan. I mean, is that modular approach why you think
Chevron is going to deliver Gorgon on budget where others have failed? And perhaps when do you think you'll be
able to, with confidence, say that you're going to hit that project on budget?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Ed, it's a great question. First, we did not use a modular approach in Tengiz on SGI/SGP. We are moving to a
more modular approach for the future growth project in the next Tengiz expansion, and it's related to just what
we've seen in Gorgon and what see to be happening in Wheatstone. It's a wise thing to move hours and use hours
in multiple places, and the only way you can do that is go to modules. So we are planning modules, significantly
large modules, on Gorgon. We will be using modular construction to I think, a little bit lesser extent on
Wheatstone, but will be still driving toward modules there. And future growth, we'll definitely move to modules as
best we can in recognition of transportation infrastructure. But great question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ed G. Westlake
Research Analyst, Credit Suisse (United States)

Q

And the second half of the question was really around – with this modular approach, at some point, you'll see how
productive the Australian workers are in terms of being able to put these together, and you'll have some idea of
where Gorgon CapEx will come in. When do you think that point will be reached?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, we've – so far in the case of Gorgon, have about $25 billion in contracts in hand. The ones that are related to
outside of Australia, we have a very good handle on them. We think that in itself mitigates the total cost. I don't
expect to really have a good feel for productivity in Australia for at least another 12 months. I think at that point in
time we'll have a good handle on the productivity situation. We're trying to put, of course, everything in place to
guarantee good productivity on Barrow Island. We're doing really quality housing and providing a great
opportunity for good food, doing all those things to make sure we have a good workforce that – on site and
minimize issues for them. Both from a safety, like I say, and a living basis.

Hi, good morning, all.

Good morning.

Paul Sankey
Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

Let me take the opportunity to thank you for the trip to Kazakhstan, which was great. And I hope in due course
you'll consider a trip to Gorgon.
George, on that trip, we were chatting about California, and you said you'd go back to your people and ask them
for, I think you said the third or fourth time, if you're missing something there. Can you update me on your latest
thoughts about California -- developments there, potential there, and so on? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Paul, we have went back. We're always looking at opportunities, particularly around where we have a big position.
For those on the phone, we have about 250,000 acres in the Southern California area of San Joaquin. We do
produce, from the Monterey in Southern California, we produce about 45,000 barrels a day in the Monterey. We
are still doing some work, Paul, in that area. We have worked, some of it, in the upper part of the Monterey in the
diatomite. We hold a lot of acreage in that. And we've seen success there. We've seen that in Lost Hills. We are
looking at some of the deeper Monterey, and we'll probably have a test of that in one of the areas we presently
hold. At this point in time, we have not changed our overall view of the Monterey relative to our other
opportunities in the world.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Paul Sankey
Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Which is that it's relatively less interesting than some of the other developments you can see, obviously?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

We don't see it yet competing. We're going to do additional work there. We typically, in all our areas where we
have long-standing production, we're always looking for ways to increase the productivity of that resource,
increase the recovery, and we see some cases of oil in place that we're going to test. Now, once again, it's got to
compete down the road for capital against our other opportunities around the world.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey
Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

Understood, George. And can you just be specific on why it's less attractive than other opportunities, and also
mention if there's any permitting issues for you there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, I'll answer the second one first. We've not gone far enough to have the permitting issues, so we don't have
any permitting issues.
At this point, we just don't see the volumetric production that delivers enough barrels at a rate to make it
economically competitive. But we've got more work to do. We're going to do a test that will tell us a little bit more
about one of these lower formation areas in the Monterey. So more to come on that. I'm sure we'll have some
feedback on that, additional feedback, even in the March time period of next year at our analyst meeting.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey
Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

Interesting, thanks. And then just a follow-up to finish off on the U.S. You've obviously highlighted the expansion
in the Marcellus. Very briefly, if there's any sort of price around what you paid? Secondly if you intend to continue
adding acreage? You've highlighted in the past that you are relatively underweight U.S. gas as an advantage. Are
you changing that view? And thirdly, if you could briefly comment on whether or not you're interested in
unconventional oil in other parts of the U.S., such as the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. And I'll leave it there. Thank
you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Paul, a lot of good questions. I'm going to ask Jeanette to help me, or Pat, if I don't answer them all, and so I may
get a little bit of prompting there to – we're trying to put together in the Marcellus a nice-sized portfolio. And
we've done a couple of steps on that. I think we're very close to putting together what we want in the Marcellus.
There will be additional additions, small additions, there where it makes sense synergistically between one
acreage we hold and these two, and is there something in between? So we'll do that, but I think we have pretty well
put together our Marcellus position.

My goal is to be able to really lay out what all we have done in the Marcellus and give everyone a really good
update in March next year. I think by that period of time, we will have all the pieces pretty well put into place.
We'll have our integration well in hand, both integrating Atlas and the Chief piece. So I think at that point we
really will be able to give everyone a full overview of what we see, where we stand, how it all fits together. But I
really don't feel comfortable in doing that until probably March. March will be the right time for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Understood. Is there a price on the – incremental to the 228,000?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

At this point in time, I'm not going to share that. What we will do, what I am committed to do, is we'll provide you
a lot more price information when we bring all the pieces together.

A

Then the other question was unconventional oil.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Unconventional – from a technical point of view, I do like – and have always said I like the – what we call light –
we call it light shaled oil. We like it. I will tell you at this point in time we've seen the pricing of the acreage to be –
well, frankly, just to be high, and it impacts the economic viability of buying it. We have done lots of technical
work looking for other opportunities around the world that are similar. We're always trying to take knowledge
gained in one location and find similar opportunities around the world. I really don't have any I want to point to at
this point. But we are doing work on there.
And Paul, like everything else, it always gets back – we don't just want barrels or Mcfs, we want those barrels that
deliver strong earnings, strong returns. And if it's inorganic and it's producing, we find it very difficult in most
cases to go ante up that money. Our strategy continues to be looking for early entry, looking for exploration
opportunities. We think the value, the major value, we create is getting it early, using our expertise from a
geotechnical side, from the reservoir engineering side, and the project side to create value. And, then, of course,
operate it well. We think that's the way we really create the value for the shareholder.

Q

So you're telling me it's very unlikely you'll make a major acquisition?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

That's correct.

Q

Q

Yeah, good morning, everyone. Another great – great quarter. And I hope Congress heard your opening
comments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Thank you, Evan. Me, too.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Yeah, a few questions. One on a bigger-look question. I know relative to peers Chevron has a significant
investment for future production growth that has not yet contributed to your earnings, as would be expected. But
can you share with me maybe the amount of your current capital employed that is not yet generating income or
impacting the numerator in your ROCE calculation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

I'd say, Evan, a good price to be would be somewhere between 25% and 30%, would be a good benchmark for you
at this point in time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Okay, and that's clearly high over time. If you had a time sequence, that's clearly a higher percentage. Is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Certainly as we move into the 30% range it is, but I would say, typically if I looked back over the last five to seven
years or so, that 25% to 30%, low 30% range is typically the bandwidth that we have operated within.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Okay. Thank you. And a second question for George, and maybe more pointed than Paul's. I mean, clearly
excitement's been building on the Utica Shale opportunity, and then something that's a bit of a focus this morning
with Chesapeake's release and conference call. And I know – and I believe Chevron has 600,000 acres that you
disclosed that has Utica oil shale exposure. But you didn't call that out in Slide 17. Maybe you could discuss how
you're thinking about activity there and play potential into 2012?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

Okay. Well, let me first say we believe it's a little bit too soon to conclude on the potential of the Utica. We've got a
good acreage position in the Utica from the Atlas acquisition. We're going to do what we do everywhere in the
world; we're going to evaluate that. And the only way we can evaluate it is we're going to have to drill some wells
and test performance. So it's something for the future. But it's, like I say, too early at this point in time, I think, to
hype it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Evan Calio
Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Is it a partial driver in your Atlas acquisition, which is largely perceived as a Marcellus gas acquisition?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

It was not a major driver in that. It was too unproven at that time to establish a lot of the value.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio

Q

Okay.

with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

Thanks. Good morning, everybody. George, if I may take advantage of you being on the phone with a couple
questions, and I have a follow-up for Pat very quickly. Can you give us an update, just generally, as to how you see
the latest permitting situation in the Gulf of Mexico? And just bolting onto maybe a general update as to when you
would expect to really be able to ramp up your activity there? That's my first. I've got a couple follow-ups, if I may.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. I'll try to give you a little bit more than we gave in the comments. To start off, all three of our deepwater rigs
are currently working. We're on Moccasin, which is a nice exploration well, and we're on Buckskin, and we're on
Tahiti. Tahiti we are about to get into the development drilling stage there. We've drilled a couple of injection
wells, all of which was needed for our second phase development of Tahiti.


On the permits themselves – so we've got permits for those, for drilling at those locations. Near-term drilling
program will require approval for us of about 10 development and exploration plans and 15 drilling permits, so
that's what we're in the process of pursuing. We have received the permit for Coronado, which is our next
exploration well, and we've also received an approved revised exploration plan for Oceanographer, as well as for
our initial development drilling operations at Jack/St. Malo. And we're continuing to progress approvals for Big
Foot development drilling. We've got a lot of applications to permit to drill have been submitted, so at this point in
time we seem to be able to move things in there, through the permit process, to allow us to progress our projects
and our exploration plans.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

Thanks, George. When do you expect ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

And in recognition of that, I'll even give you a little – we have two additional deepwater rigs expected to arrive
later this year, the Deepwater Discovery India and the Pacific Santa Ana. And these two rigs really are focused on
drilling initial development wells for our major capital projects. That's Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot. And that'll
allow us to really start – and maybe a little bit of catch-up – on what time we lost, because we lost over a year in
time. So we're trying to – and it's – you can't recapture time, but we're trying to put ourselves in a position to
make sure those projects come on and we have development wells to produce into them as they move into the
production stage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

Thanks, George. Broadly, would you say things are getting – "easier" is not the word I'm looking for, but less
onerous perhaps, in terms of the actual permits, do you think BOEMRE is actually starting to move things through
a little quicker? Any perspective would be appreciated.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

I think the biggest contributor to the improvement in getting permits is really – I think people now better
understanding what is required. The requirements to get a permit, the technical requirements, what must be done
to make progress to the point of getting the permit is much better determined and understood. And that's big.
Once you know what you got to do, then you can attack it and you can deliver, once again, a document that meets
the needs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate

Q

Got it, thank you. Jumping around the world to – just very quickly to Liberia. Can you give us an update as to –
just remind us what your working interest is there, when you would expect to really start to – the activity to pick
up, and just a general kind of update of your expectations.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.


My memory is working interest is in the 80% level for us on three large blocks there. I'm going to ask somebody to
double-check that for me as I go on. We're very pleased with that. We see this as that Cretaceous trend that we've
seen in West Africa. It's been very successful in Ghana. We're moving forward with our first well to be drilled, to
be spudded. And my expectation's it'll be in the fourth quarter, but we're on schedule for that. We've lined up a rig.
So we're in, I think, good stead to drill the first well or start drilling the first well this year. Pleased with that. We
see – from a geological point of view, we see a large number of prospects. But, once again, remember, this is
exploration. It's a long ways from any well that's in close proximity, where we'll be drilling, so a significant
distance. But it looks good at this point from the seismic point. So we'll know a lot more after we drill the first well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

Thanks, George. Last one from me is, I guess, a follow-up to Paul's question in California. Fairly modest, I guess,
overall position in the context of Chevron's scale, but my recollection was that you had sold a lot of your deep
rights about 10 years ago to Occidental. Can you confirm if that was case, and how much running room you
actually have in the deeper Santos Monterey area?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

In the Santos area, we do not have a lot of acreage. I don't have that number right in front of me, but that is not
where our position is. We'll have to get that as a follow-up either – I guess next quarter or between our IR folks. I
don't have that number right with me. But we are not positioned large there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Just got a – I just got some help on that. In Liberia we're 70%. We have a 70% working interest, just to correct
that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

Thanks for the clarification. My very quick follow-up is – was for Pat. Pat, your net cash position – your share
buybacks are still very modest. Just some context as to why you're not yet choosing to get a little more aggressive.
And I'll leave it at that. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

All right. Yeah, Doug, our belief here is – and I think we said this when we reinstated the share repurchase
program – we deliberately put flexibility on it in terms of time and in terms of dollars. And we want to be able to
sustain the share repurchase program over a long period of time and be able to live through any sort of
uncertainties. So our approach is perhaps a little bit more modest than you might think, but our objective there is
to be able to have something that we can sustain over time.

I think you would agree with us here that there's a fair amount of uncertainty out there. Certainly what we saw in
terms of the U.S. GDP this morning, China GDP has been dampening a little bit – still very strong but dampening
a little bit. We've clearly got uncertainty in terms of the U.S. policy environment. And all we are trying to
acknowledge is that there can be – while we're favorably inclined about prices over the medium term and long
term, there can be excursions south of that for short periods of time, and we just want to be able to, once we go
into the share repurchase program, keep it on track and sustained. So that really is our philosophy.

Jason D. Gammel
Research Analyst, Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.

Q

Thank you. Good morning, all. George, I had a question about the upstream margin and the strong capture rate
you're getting there. I know that part of the contribution to your move into the number one position was from a lot
of the new projects that had been brought online over the last couple of years. And so my question is, are you
expecting to move past cost recovery mode in any of these projects that are in PSCs that maybe would ratchet
down the margin capture? Or then conversely, would you expect the margin capture to actually continue moving
forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Jason, it's a good question that's got a awful lot of moving parts. Let me start there. Yes, we are moving on some
cases on the PSCs to the point where we have much of the capture of the initial investments. It's complicated by
recognizing that in many cases, as we move to that point, we also move into later phases, like in Agbami 2, we
move into a second phase of development which continues some of that capture. So you have those. And recognize
we also have new projects coming on. An example, actually in the same area of the world, Usan will come on next
year in deepwater Nigeria, so we've got another one that way.
So these ins and outs, I would tell you that the quality of the new assets coming on, they are very strong in their
earnings power. They have very strong earnings per barrel. What I can't tell you is I really don't have a – it's hard
for me to get a view of my competitors and what's happening in their portfolio. And I wish I could get a better
handle on that myself, which I'm sure all of – matter of fact, maybe that's a question, as I see some of you, you'll
help me on that. Thanks for the question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason D. Gammel
Research Analyst, Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.

Q

Well, I'll keep you penciled in as number one then. Maybe if I could shift to the exploration program in Australia.
Unlike some of the other operators in the area, you've really kind of kept the drill bit in front of the marketing
activity. And I know that your view has been that you have more than enough gas for the five trains that are either
sanctioned at Gorgon or are about to be sanctioned at Wheatstone. If you think about the resource base, what do
you actually think you could underpin now in terms of numbers of trains at 5 million tons per annum? And in a
blue-sky case, do you think you'd be able to do a train a year for 10 years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Oh. Let me start – we got three trains at Gorgon. To get everybody oriented, we got three trains at Gorgon that are
a little over 15 million tons. We have almost 9 million tons – 8.9 million tons – in the two trains at Wheatstone.
On the case of Gorgon, my confidence of having resource for the fourth train is high. We still, I think – and we are
drilling lots of exploration wells – I think we've got to continue that to have the confidence in additional trains.
Barrow Island, we will not be able to put anything on beyond five trains. And five trains is, like I say, that's all
that's going to fit there. We have a lot more space in the case of the Ashburton North site for Wheatstone. It can
probably handle six trains. Confidence level is good in the two trains that we're moving close to FID. And we have
discoveries in the 205 block there, and that's the Clio 1, 2, 3 discoveries and Acme. And now we're doing an Acme
follow-up, so we're trying to prove up a quantity of gas there that would give us a lot of confidence in a third train.
Remember, the other one unique thing that we're trying to do and I think are doing – and you can see it through
our participation in the first two trains with Apache KUFPEC – we're trying to build a hub there that will allow
other third parties to bring in gas and to do it in an economical manner. So we're always trying to provide that
opportunity set also. And I think that gives us confidence that – that combination of our drilling, plus the more
open access, will allow for additional trains to be built at Wheatstone, at the Onslow site.

Senior Vice
President, Barclays

Thank you. Good morning, guys.

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Good morning.
<<Q – [05KTLM-E]Paul Cheng – Barclays Capital, Inc.>: I have two questions for George and one really quick
follow-up for Pat. George, I suppose that when you initially invested in Atlas Energy as a partner, you see it as a
great resource base, partly maybe is that – using it as a beachhead to learn about the shale gas technology and
how to operate there. But shale gas and shale oil, they are quite different from one play to another. So do you think
that the position there that already allowed you to have sufficient [indiscernible] (53:50) learning experience to
fully understand and expand that knowledge base to the rest of your global portfolio or that you may need a
beachhead in other play?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay, let me – having access to Atlas for us is very important. It's the – the process of actually doing makes a lot of
difference. We see challenges in the way moneys are spent presently in the unconventional gas. One that our – the
first one is we don't believe it takes as many frac stages – you don't have to frac as much of that formation if you
truly understand the sweeter spots, if you will, of that formation. So the only way I think we can prove that and
really grow that expertise and become better and more economical at doing it is by doing it. So we're trying to do
that, of course. And then what we want to do is to be able to apply that technology, that technical ability, to other
places in the world. We see that as particularly important for us as we move into Eastern Europe. Because we
don't see the infrastructure capability by service providers to be nearly as available as what we see in the U.S. So
that's how we tie the two of those together. So we want to get technically a whole lot smarter, and we want to use
what we learn there and be able to apply it around the world.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

But – sure. I mean, that's fully understand. But George, my question is that, given that each formation is
somewhat different, from what we understand, so having a substantial position in Marcellus, is that what you
believe already gives you sufficient of the learning curve or that you need exposure to other areas? That's my
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, I think the case of the Marcellus – the Marcellus was the quality of the Marcellus that took us there, and the
proximity to market. We had opportunity on scale, relatively early entry, quality. All of that took us there at this
point in time. Europe – Europe's once again a combination of that, with a lot less geotechnical information being
known. We've got to drill some wells, we've done G&G, we'll be drilling our first wells in Poland this year, and we'll
start answering the questions. Drill the well, get more technical information. We'll eventually have to be fracking
wells. We've got to go through that, Paul, and that's what's going to answer the question. We wanted to get scale in
Europe initially where, if it works, you've got the scale to make a really nice business. And remember, the entry
cost in Europe was much different than what the bets are in the United States.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Okay. All right. And the second quick one is that for George, is – Bulgaria, I presume that you just acquired the
acres, so you're going to do seismic this year and we should not expect a first well until late 2012?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, I don't expect – I'm not even sure we're going to get the seismic started this year. I – really looking more at
the seismic next year. And this is so recent, I think it's a little early to even talk when the first well. But we'll have
more on that in the oncoming quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Okay. Then a quick one for Pat. In the past, I think, from an accounting standpoint, Chevron, the Gulf of Mexico
oil realization is based on a one-month lag. I just want to – curious if that's still the case here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Katherine Lucas Minyard
Senior Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Hi, good morning. Thanks very much. Just a quick question on your buyback program. I realize you talked a little
bit about it earlier, but when you're looking at buybacks versus dividends and that redeployment of excess cash or
that return to shareholders, it looks like your average diluted share count hasn't really declined over the last
several quarters despite the buyback program. So I was curious as to what factors you're weighing, given that you
want the program to be sustainable as well, as you look at distributing that cash through buybacks versus through
dividends?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

That's a good question, Kate. You're right, there hasn't been as much of a reduction in the outstanding shares, and
that's simply been a function of the exercise of some stock options by annuitants in their 10-year window. And
we've taken a look at that, and it's been obviously driven by how well our share price has done, particularly in the
first quarter and second quarter here. When we peg our share repurchase program, we don't really have
knowledge to take that other effect into account. So when we talk about our share repurchase program, we really
are talking about the amount that we have control over, and therefore the $1 billion – or now upping it to $1.25
billion in the quarter here.
And in terms of the dividend play versus the share repurchase play, I think I've been on record many times now in
talking about our financial priorities, and the first one really is to sustain and grow the dividend. And we did show
a dividend increase here in the second quarter of 8%. So that's the primary distribution to shareholders that we
pursue. Share repurchases are a much more discretionary piece, and we peg that to what we consider the shortterm, medium-term, and longer-term outlook of cash generation, surplus cash generation, for the company.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Katherine Lucas Minyard
Senior Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Okay, sure. Thanks very much. And then if I could quickly ask on the PNZ it looks like production's kind of come
down over the last say two, two and a half years. Just curious as to whether that's entitlements related or if it's
decline, and then whether the outlook would be that we'd look for an increase as the flooding program kind of gets
more under way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

The PZ is – the concession there is a tax and royalty, so it's not a PSC, so there's no effect, price effect there. And it
has declined. Existing fields are on a decline – not a lot, but a little bit of decline. The upside, the future, is really
about the steamflood, where we see opportunities that could be on a gross basis – we could end up with a
production gain there on new production up to 500,000 barrels a day. There's a big opportunity there. We have
just – for those, maybe a little bit of information. We just recompleted into the First Eocene [ph] B-zone (1:01:19)
recently and should start our steamflood test there on that second zone in the First Eocene.

Iain S. Reid
Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Hi, guys. Got three questions, one for Pat and a couple for George. Pat, just looking at your slides on the
downstream, for international, you talk about this timing effect, which I assume is the inventory effect, of a
positive $155 million. Just curious as to why there wasn't a similar one for U.S. downstream given the fact that oil
prices increased so much and therefore there must have been some gains in your downstream inventory.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Right. Actually, Iain, that large bar that you see there on international earnings called "timing effects," this time is
largely a variance between different positions in open paper between the quarters, mark-to-market effects
between the quarters. It's not really as inventory-driven as it is mark-to-market driven.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Iain S. Reid
Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Oh, okay. Is it possible to say, then, what the overall inventory effect was in the downstream, just kind of roughly,
if you don't have a kind of exact number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

No. I mean, I think that it's not a place we want to go. We don't have a number that's handy like that, and I'd hate
to speculate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Iain S. Reid
Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Okay, all right. George, specific to you. Can I come back on Ed's question about costs in Australia? I understand
you've got a fair amount of Gorgon contracted, so that probably gives you a reasonable amount of comfort in
terms of the costs there, but I'm just wondering about Wheatstone. Coming out to FID, and I presume you've
tested the market for similar equipment, turbines, the gas coolers, et cetera. I'm just wondering what you're seeing
– in terms of a cost differential between those two projects – since obviously you're going to use some pretty
similar equipment and obviously probably pretty much the same labor force.

You're absolutely right, Iain, that we do have good cost test data. Matter of fact, we're in hand in many cases with
contracts as we approach FID that we will be able to issue and execute. So we have a pretty good handle on that.
That's very typical of our projects when we get to FID. We really have an awful lot of both the purchased
equipment and many contracts where we have a pricing – beyond a pricing view, we have a contract that we can
execute. We have boiled those into our plans for the FID and our requests for funds. I can't give you a number at
this point in time until we get post-FID. We'll be able to give some of that information – our expectation is in the
fourth quarter that we will be at FID. So that probably sets us up, good timing to do that in the March analyst
meeting.

Yeah, but it is fair to say, I presume, you're seeing some reasonable inflation coming through from the awards you
did on Gorgon a couple years ago to what you're seeing in Wheatstone now, without giving a number?

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

I will just tell you we feel we have a very good handle on the pricing. We still believe we are getting some good
pricing due to the way we have contracted elements of the project.

All right. Sorry. I'm not trying to extract anything from you you shouldn't do.

You said you have one last one?

Q

Yeah, I do, I do. It's about Tengiz. And can I thank you all again, all of you, including obviously Investor Relations,
for a great trip over there, echoing what Paul said. I've just got a question about the future growth projects. I think
when we were over there, you were talking about being in a position to launch FEED. And the government was
kind of sitting on it for some reason. I'm just kind of wondering where you are now and whether you managed to
move that one forward at all, and what that means in terms of timing of the project.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & EVP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.

A

I think we are moving forward on it. I still believe that we're on schedule for at least a fourth quarter FEED
appropriation to be approved. I think most of our issues that we've covered, we've covered. And I'm sure hopeful
that we're going to make that target date. So – but we aren't there yet. I'll tell you that. So we're making progress,
but we're not there yet.

Okay, at this point I'd like to wrap it up. I'd like to say that I appreciate everyone's participation on the call today
and everyone's interest in Chevron. I especially want to thank the analysts who asked some very good questions.
I'm sure they helped everybody's understanding of the company. So thank you very much, everyone.
