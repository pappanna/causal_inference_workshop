Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to
Chevron's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that
time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr.
Mike Wirth. Please go ahead.

Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call
with me today are Pat Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Mount, General Manager
of Investor Relations.
We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that
this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review
the cautionary statement on slide 2.

Moving to slide 3, this is a scorecard outlining performance against our 2017 commitments. We had a good year
and accomplished what we set out to do. We met our objective to get cash balanced. In fact, we were cash
balanced without relying on proceeds from asset sales. We stayed below budget on capital spending and
continued our downward trend in operating expenses.
We grew new high-margin production, consistent with our guidance. We realized value from asset sales, with
proceeds of more than $8 billion over two years, above the midpoint of the target range. And we ended the year
within the debt range we predicted. 2017 was a very successful year. We're proud of our progress, and we intend
to build on this momentum in 2018.
Moving to slide 4, as you can see from the bar chart, 2017 cash flow, including asset sales and before dividends,
grew more than $17 billion from 2016. Some of this growth was a result of rising prices, and some was from an
increase in asset sale proceeds. But the majority was due to specific actions we took to improve cash generation
for our operations. And the result, we were cash flow positive without asset sales in 2017, a full year earlier than
our commitment, with a little help from prices. And we entered 2018 with strong momentum.
We know who owns our stock and what they expect. Our number one financial priority is to maintain and grow the
dividend, when we can sustainably support the increase with cash flow and earnings. That's why earlier this week,
we announced a dividend increase of $0.04 per share, putting us on track to make 2018 the 31st consecutive
year of increased annual per-share dividend payout.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat, who will take you through the financial results. Pat?

All right. Thank you, Mike. Starting with slide 5, an overview of our financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings
were $3.1 billion or $1.64 per diluted share, while 2017 full-year earnings were $9.2 billion. In the quarter, we had
two special items. We recorded a non-cash provisional gain of $2 billion related to U.S. tax reform. We also
recognized a non-cash remediation charge of $190 million associated with a former mining asset.
Foreign exchange losses for the quarter were $96 million. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign
exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange
impacts, earnings for the quarter totaled $1.4 billion or $0.72 per share. For the full year, earnings on this same
basis totaled $7 billion.
Full-year cash flow from operations was $20.5 billion. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $6.2 billion,
reflecting strong upstream production and higher realizations. Downstream results were noticeably lower than in
the third quarter, and I'll say more on that in just a moment.
Excluding the $2 billion deferred tax provision I just mentioned, the three items we have called out all year as
headwinds to cash flow, meaning changes in working capital, affiliate dividends less than earnings, and deferred
taxes, aggregated to around $3 billion for the year. For the quarter, these components represented a tailwind of
approximately $350 million, in large part because of working capital effects. In the quarter, we had a noticeable
increase in international income taxes payable. For the full year, working capital was a minor benefit.
Return on capital employed for 2017 was 5%. Our debt ratio at year-end was 21%, and our net debt ratio was
approximately 18%.

During the fourth quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. You are already aware that we announced an increase
in our quarterly dividend to $1.12 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of February 16. We currently
yield 3.6%.
Now on slide 6, slide 6 compares full-year 2017 earnings with 2016. Full-year 2017 earnings were approximately
$9.7 billion higher than 2016 results. Special items, primarily a U.S. tax reform gain of $2 billion, lower
impairments and other charges of $1.9 billion, and increased gains from asset sales of $1 billion, benefited
earnings by $4.9 billion. A swing in foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings between periods by $504 million.
The passage of tax reform legislation in late December required that we revalue our net deferred tax liability to
reflect the new lower 21% tax rate. Earnings impacts from this adjustment are evident in all three of our reporting
segments. And again, I will refer you to the appendix for the detailed segmented information.
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by about $5.1 billion between
periods. Higher realizations, increased volumes, and lower costs were partially offset by higher DD&A, which was
mostly associated with increased production.
Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by just under $400 million. Higher
margins were partially offset by lower volumes and lower earnings from CPChem, mainly due to the impacts of
Hurricane Harvey.
Full-year 2017 Other segment results were in line with our guidance. Our 2018 guidance for the Other segment is
$2.4 billion in net charges. This includes approximately $600 million of interest expense that was previously
capitalized and $300 million worth of incremental tax effects, as net charges are deducted at the lower rate postU.S. tax reform. As a reminder, our quarterly results in this segment are non-ratable.
Turning to slide 7, we're aware of the challenges of modeling an integrated company like Chevron, and in
particular, modeling downstream results in a quarter where oil prices rose as fast as they did. I'd therefore like to
provide some additional commentary.
Our downstream margins were squeezed by rising feedstock costs. We estimate this adverse margin effect
between third quarter and fourth quarter to be about $500 million across our operations, but specifically on the
West Coast, where we have two of our three main U.S. refineries. Industry refinery utilization in PADD 5 was very
strong during the second half of the quarter, leading to abundant supplies and putting even greater pressure on
margins.
We also experienced adverse impacts from two hurricanes. We estimate a further $190 million penalty from these
relative to the third quarter. I am referencing both Hurricane Nate at Pascagoula, where a precautionary shutdown
was taken; and Hurricane Harvey, which flooded CPChem's Cedar Bayou plant. While the hurricanes were known
to have hit our facilities, sizing the financial impact would have been difficult.
I'd note that these fourth quarter impacts are not structural, they are transitory. And we believe the fundamentals
around demand, supply, production, prices, and margins for refined products and chemicals are positive for 2018.
The Other segment for the quarter was a sizable negative, but the full-year charges were aligned with the
guidance I gave on the third quarter call.


And lastly but very importantly, we had very solid results in upstream in the quarter. Our strong operating
performance was complemented by rising prices, and both favorable elements are expected to continue in 2018.
As you know, our earnings and cash flows are highly leveraged to crude prices, and this leverage is expected to
grow as our production grows in 2018.
Turning now to slide 8, slide 8 illustrates 2017 production of 2.73 million barrels a day, an increase of 134,000
barrels a day or 5% up from 2016. Major capital projects increased production by 240,000 barrels a day, as we
started and ramped up multiple projects, including Gorgon and Angola LNG.
Lower plant turnaround effects, primarily at Tengiz, favorably impacted production between periods by 34,000
barrels a day. Shale and tight production increased 46,000 barrels a day, primarily due to the growth in the
Midland and Delaware Basins and the Permian.
Base declines, net of production from new wells such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria, were 45,000
barrels a day. PSC effects reduced production by 68,000 barrels a day, as rising prices and lower spend reduced
cost recovery barrels. The impact of asset sales, mainly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Mid-Continent, reduced
production by 66,000 barrels a day.
I will now turn it back to Mike.

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

All right, thanks, Pat.
Turning to slide 9, reserve replacement is a real success story. As this chart shows, over the last five years, we
have added about 400 million more barrels than we produced and divested. Our reserve replacement ratio was
155% in 2017 and 107% over the last five years. We're especially pleased with this outcome because it was
achieved on top of growing production last year.
Our reserves to production ratio stands at a healthy 11.7, demonstrating the strength and sustainability of our
business. In 2017, the Permian was the largest contributor to reserve additions, where we continue to lower our
cost structure, focus our investment, and develop our resources in a capital efficient manner. As we continue to
ramp up our rig fleet, we are confident this pattern should continue. We also saw significant adds elsewhere
across the portfolio, including from the Gorgon Project, where well performance has been encouraging.
Moving to slide 10. This chart shows the continued progress we've made on spend reduction. As you can see,
capital and operating expenses were down again this year. 2017 C&E spending was $18.8 billion, down $3.6
billion from the prior year and more than $21 billion from three years earlier.
2017 full year operating costs were more than $1 billion lower than 2016, despite higher upstream production.
When compared to 2014, we're down by nearly $6 billion. I expect us to maintain capital and cost discipline. We
are improving work processes, negotiating better rates from contractors and vendors, and becoming more
efficient in all that we do. And technology offers opportunities for even more. We are in a cyclical commodity
business. Capital discipline always matters. Costs always matter.
Now to slide 11 and asset sales. This chart shows asset sale proceeds of $8 billion over the last two years, with
$5.2 billion coming in 2017. The two-year total is above the midpoint of our guidance range of $5 billion to $10
billion. Moving forward, we will continue to optimize our portfolio where appropriate, using proceeds to support
stronger asset and shareholder returns. The criteria for divestments is straightforward. We will plan to sell assets
that don't have a strategic fit or won't compete for capital and are worth more to someone else, and when we can
receive good value. We don't discuss specific assets until we are into a transaction. We have one of these
underway, the sale of our Southern Africa refining and marketing business, which is expected to close in 2018.
Moving to slide 12, our Australian LNG assets are becoming strong cash generators, with cash margins of more
than $30 per barrel at $50 Brent price. Currently, four trains are online and running well. Well performance for
both projects looks good. During the fourth quarter, we completed pit stops on Gorgon Train 1 and Train 3 to
improve reliability and increase production. Gorgon's average January production was 449,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day, up 86,000 barrels from the fourth quarter average on a 100% basis. During 2017, Gorgon
shipped 170 cargos.
At Wheatstone, during the fourth quarter, we started Train 1, reached design capacity, and successfully
addressed the commissioning strainers, which is a standard part of commissioning this type of LNG plant design.
Wheatstone Train 1 average January production was 86,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a 100% basis.
First LNG for Wheatstone Train 2 is slated for second quarter 2018, with startup for Wheatstone domestic gas the
following quarter.
Now, let's go to the Permian on slide 13. Production in the Permian continues to exceed expectations as we drive
further efficiency gains and improved well performance. In the fourth quarter, we produced approximately 205,000
barrels per day, up approximately 60,000 barrels per day from the same period in 2016.
Full-year 2017 production averaged 181,000 barrels per day, up 35% over the prior year. We are currently
operating 16 rigs in the basin and plan to end this year with 20 company operated rigs. And in support of our
development program, we are currently employing six pressure pumping crews.
I will update you on progress to optimize our land position in the Permian on slide 14. In 2017, we enhanced the
value of our position by transacting more than 60,000 acres through various swaps, joint ventures, farm-outs, and
sales. These transactions improve capital efficiency and create value by consolidating land positions, allowing
longer laterals and other infrastructure efficiencies.
Last year's transactions enabled nearly 600 additional long laterals to be added to our well inventory. We intend to
continue this activity to consolidate our land positions and optimize the value of our future developments. We'll
provide further information on the Permian at our Analyst Day in early March.
Now let's move to the overall production outlook on slide 15. For this year, production at $60 Brent is expected to
be 4% to 7% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2018 asset sales. Growth is expected to driven by
– be driven by LNG in Australia, shale and tight, particularly in the U.S. and Canada, and other capital projects.
Partially offsetting that will be full-year impacts of 2017 asset sales and base decline.
The forecasted production range reflects the uncertainties associated with startup timing, rates of production,
project ramp-up, base decline, and external events. In summary, we anticipate another year of strong production
growth.
Moving to slide 16, we've had a number of recent developments that I'd like to knowledge. Earlier this week, we
announced a major discovery in the U.S. deepwater Gulf of Mexico at Ballymore. This discovery has 670 feet of
net oil pay with excellent reservoir and fluid characteristics. And importantly, it's close to our existing Blind Faith
platform. We are currently drilling a sidetrack well to further evaluate the extent of the resource.

Also this week, we confirmed a major discovery at the Whale prospect in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where we are a
40% partner. This find is approximately 10 miles from the Perdido platform. These discoveries are exciting for
both their resource potential and their proximity to existing infrastructure, which offers the possibility for faster and
more capital efficient development.
Also this week, we along with our partners were successful bidders on a large deepwater block in Mexico, adding
to our position there. An installation is underway at Big Foot. We've installed 7 of the 16 mooring tendons. On
Tuesday, the tension-leg platform sailed from the dry dock facility in Ingleside, Texas. First production is forecast
for late this year.
In downstream, CPChem reached mechanical completion of the Gulf Coast cracker in December and has begun
the process of commissioning. We expect to start up later this quarter and reach full production in the second
quarter of 2018. You recall that the derivative units achieved first production in September of last year.
Finally, on tax reform, we believe the new legislation is good for business and for consumers. It's a positive for
Chevron, making attractive investment opportunities in the Permian, the Gulf of Mexico, and in our U.S.
downstream and chemicals business look even better. Our U.S. capital and exploratory spend is expected to be
approximately $8 billion this year and some $25 billion over the next three years.
Moving to slide 17, I'd like to share a few closing thoughts. Over the last decade-plus, I've had the opportunity to
get to know many of you. I've been listening, and your input has been helpful as I move into my new role. I'm
guided by my background, experience, and a few core beliefs. I grew up playing sports and I like to win. I intend
to lead Chevron to win in any environment.
To win, you need to have clear convictions. Here are some of mine. We must be disciplined and returns-driven in
capital allocation. Our cost structure needs to improve further. Costs always matter. We can get more out of the
assets that we have as we can operate them better and more reliably. We can optimize across the entire value
chain to capture more value. And we need to continue to high grade our portfolio and our resource base to build
the assets to win today and tomorrow, not yesterday.
For those of you I know, I look forward to seeing you more in the coming months and years. For those of you I
don't, I look forward to meeting you. I'm committed to continuing to grow cash flow, improve returns, and deliver
value to our shareholders.
That concludes our prepared remarks and we will be happy to take your questions. Jonathan, please open the
lines.

Q

So I guess I'll start with – I have one for Pat and one for Mike. So, Pat, you talked about these moving pieces
around CFO items, these transitory factors that have been going on throughout 2017. And I was just curious how
you think about 2018 with those factors: deferred tax, working capital, equity affiliates. Does that continue to be a
headwind? Does it dissipate in any way?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

So I think the short answer would be to a large extent, there will be some continuing factors. The largest single
component there would be the difference that we would expect between affiliate earnings and affiliate dividends.
That will continue to be a component there. The harder one to predict clearly will be what's happening on the
deferred tax side of things. That will be very price-dependent. And then, of course, working capital is always very
hard as well.
But if I assume that there's no change in working capital, just assume prices at the beginning of the year are the
same as at the end of the year, and our activity levels are relatively flattish, so no impact from working capital.
And I put the other two components together, so the affiliate distributions versus earnings component as well as
an estimate around deferred taxes, I would say somewhere on the order of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion worth of
headwinds would be the best estimate.
But I have to say I reserve the right at any time to come back and tell you a different number of prices that are
significantly different than where they are today.

Phil M. Gresh

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

I understand. I appreciate that. Mike, just on your final remarks that you made, appreciate those. And I guess my
follow-up to that would be we saw a nice hike in the dividend, $0.04. And as we think about the cash flow profile
for the company heading into 2018 at current price levels, it seems like you have a lot of excess cash. So any
initial thoughts you could share with us about how you think about deploying that cash? Is there room for
buybacks if prices hold where they are?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Phil, the first thing I'd say is our priorities have been consistent for quite some time and I have no expectation that
those will change. So dividends come first and you've seen that. And I'm pleased that the board saw – has a
confident view of our future and was willing to authorize the increase you just saw. Reinvestment in the business,
we've talked about that. And we've got our budget outlined and a good program underway this year.
Third, is balance sheet and we have gone from having relatively, for us, higher levels of debt down to a range
lower – or within the range that we had indicated further. And then of course, historically, when we've had cash
surplus to those needs, we have bought back shares. So I think we will continue to be consistent in those
priorities. It's always a balance across all of those.
And we've really been in a period where we've seen three years of declining or unexciting commodity prices and
three months of encouraging ones. I think it's a little premature to get ahead of ourselves on this. But the dividend
increase was certainly a signal that we feel good about where our business is positioned, the fact that we're cash
balanced. And if we continue to be in a constructive environment, obviously we'll have cash to balance across all
of those priorities, so more to follow.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate

Q

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Thanks, good morning – I think it's still morning. Good morning, everybody. And, Mike, congrats on officially
taking the reins and getting on the call this morning.
I have two questions. I guess one is a follow-up to Phil's. And it really relates to the strong performance in the
Permian. You've positioned the Permian in the past as something of an offset to base decline, but obviously it's a
pretty strong growth asset in its own right. Is that how we should think about the Permian, as basically a means of
resetting your sustaining capital, or should we think about it as something that can actually become a bit more of
a top line growth engine for the company?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

I think if you look at it on its own, it clearly is a growth engine. The nature of the activity is more aligned with what
you would traditionally think of our base business. It's ongoing drilling of wells that individually carry with them a
low risk profile that are relatively quick to execute. And it's the kind of thing that over time you can flex that up or
you can flex it down.
So one of the reasons I think it's been useful for people to think about putting base and shale and tight together is
their operational characteristics, their flexibility, the cycle time, the risk profile have more in common than our
base business does with the really large major capital projects that we've had. So I do think you can think of them
together.
We've done a really nice job of mitigating our base decline on its own. And then when you add the shale and tight
with it, the growth there is actually – and you can see on slide 8, greater than the base decline is. And so we've
got low risk, a very predictable, flexible, and controllable growth offsetting that base decline and giving us a strong
foundation as we move forward that just has a very, very different risk profile than a long-cycle major capital
project where there's a big bang at the end, but there's a greater latency period.
So, we'll certainly talk more about this in March, but I think it's one of the fundamental shifts in the outlook for our
company. I think it's a fundamental shift in the risk profile and the variability around our cash flows. And frankly, it
really underpins a really good story as we move forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate

Q

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

I appreciate the full answer. My follow-up is really talking back to the breakfast you hosted in December. And it
really relates to, I think, a comment you made about the culture of cost reduction from other parts of the business
hadn't really – and not to put words in your mouth, but hadn't translated into E&P during a period of growth,
obviously. So I'm just curious. Are you happy with the cost structure in the E&P business and the maturity profile
of the underlying portfolio? And I guess it's a roundabout way of saying should we expect another reset in the
asset sales program as we go forward? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

All right, there are a couple of things there, I think cost culture and then portfolio. The entire industry as
commodity prices went into this surge and then stayed strong for a long period of time had incentives to try to
capitalize on that. And there's no doubt that the cost structure within the industry grew as a result of that.
Most of my working life has been spent in a part of business where those periods of time are infrequent and short
in duration. And so I come from a mindset that you always have to be looking at cost. And in particular, you need
to be very cost-conscious at a time when external conditions are incenting you to be less so. And so I think that
being focused on efficiency throughout the cycle is one of the keys to success. I tried to make that point in my
closing remarks there.

Our upstream business has done a fantastic job in getting their costs down, and I'm really pleased with what I've
seen and what's been accomplished. And so there's been great progress. I mentioned $6 billion in spend
reduction over the last few years.
I think going forward, the challenge is how do we sustain that momentum. And there's an opportunity to
continuously focus on this, to challenge everything that we do for more efficiency; to look for technology, which I
think can unlock a lot of cost reduction, and then to leverage some of the things we are learning in our Permian
activity and our shale and tight activity and ask how does this apply across other parts of the business. So it's a
long answer to saying yes, I expect us to continue to work on costs irrespective of the external environment.
When I moved to portfolio, I made a comment about focusing on those assets that are the ones that will allow us
to compete and win today and tomorrow. And I do expect us to invest in those things that we think are the assets
that will be highly competitive as we move into the future and to test ourselves on the things that may have been
really important in our past and may still be or may not be as we go forward.
So the last couple of years, our asset transaction activity has been in part at least driven by the intent to get cash
balanced. As we move forward, it's driven more by the intent to ensure we've got a portfolio that's highly
competitive, that delivers strong returns, and is set up to compete in the future.

please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Hey, thanks and congrats, Mike. I actually want to follow up where you left off there on the asset sales program
and any early thoughts on 2018. You've been through a two-year pretty substantial divestiture program, fewer
things on the docket, it seems like, in 2018. So how should we think about what the new normal is for
divestitures?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Neil, I think you should expect us to continue to monetize assets where we can get fair value and they are worth
more to someone else than they are to us. And we have gone through a lot. You've seen those closed. The Gulf
of Mexico shelf exit was one where those assets have some running life ahead of them. Within our portfolio, they
will struggle to compete for capital. In somebody else's portfolio, they will draw capital and investments and
continue to create value for that company. And so we probably have other assets that would – could fit that
profile. So I think when we get to our Analyst Day in March, we'll probably speak to this a little bit more.

But my view is you can't fall in love with your portfolio. You have to constantly challenge whether or not it will
compete in the future. And you have to be willing to make move to invest in the things that you believe are highly
competitive. And be willing to face the realities in things that you are less likely to fund and that you may be able
to redeploy that cash into assets that strengthen your competitive position. So more of an optimization philosophy.
It's what we've done in other parts of the business and it served us very well. And we'll talk to you more about that
as we have things that are ready to be discussed publicly.

Q

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

I appreciate that, Mike. And then, in the slide, the 4% to 7% production growth in 2018 I think has been generally
well received. It's still a relatively wide range relative to the base of production that you have. Can you talk about
some of those uncertainties that could drive you to the upper end or the lower end of the range?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. So I realize there's a bit of a range there. What we've done is try to reflect the realities that project startups
are things that – we've got plans and then you work hard to deliver those. But there can be some variability in
startups. And then you've got ramp-ups as well. And I guess the final thing that I would say is you do have
unexpected events that can get you. We've experienced sabotage. The Partitioned Zone is still down and that
was not something that was necessarily anticipated. We work in parts of the world that have challenging
environments and things happen. So there's a range there.
Clearly, we are working to deliver strong growth and would expect to be within that range. Over the years, we've
ended up on Mr. Sankey's Porcupine Chart, I think, when we've gotten out over our skis a little bit. So, I'm trying
to be sure that we can give you a range that we're confident in. And this year, we gave you a range that was a
little wider maybe than you would have liked. But we landed squarely in the middle of that. And so, we're just
trying to reflect the realities that these things are – they're not precisely forecastable, but we're trying to show you

Mike, having said all that, there's a theme of the day, which is cash flows that you guys are generating. And you
did mention cash flow breakeven or balance. And when we look at oil at $60 for the quarter-ish, I guess, we're
totally perplexed by why cash flows – and you've given an ex working capital number, why cash flows are so low,
given the move in oil. Could you talk about where that's going to go next year? And whether if oil prices were to
persist, what we would expect to see for cash flows versus CapEx from the Company? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, so Pat's given you some of the pieces. And if she wants to try to go a little deeper, I will invite her to in a
second. I've got to tell you, Paul, I'm very pleased and optimistic with the outlook for cash flow. Our cash flow from
operations improved every quarter during 2017. I cited a few other things that are already evident this year, which
is significantly stronger production in January at Gorgon, significantly stronger production already this year at
Wheatstone, significantly stronger production in the Permian in a price environment that you've just described.
The downstream issues that we faced in the fourth quarter are nonstructural, they are not repeating. Hurricanes
happen, but they tend not to hit the same places every year. And margins in the business can ebb and flow. We
don't have structural issues in the downstream at all. Our downstream has been a strong contributor of earnings,
returns, and cash flow for many, many years.
So I used the word momentum a couple of times in my remarks. And we, in fact, do have momentum in cash
flows. So we got growing production; the production we are bringing online is cash flow accretive. I mentioned
that our LNG out of Australia is $30 cash margin at a $50 Brent price. Obviously, we are above that today.
So, all the fundamental drivers of cash flow are moving in the right direction. There's a few headwinds, which Pat
touched on. But the fundamentals here are very strong and those are what I'm focused on. So I feel good about
2018.

Clearly, if we have a year that's above $50 Brent, we will be better than cash balanced without asset sales. And
you also mentioned capital in there, Paul. So let me just touch on that.
We've got a capital budget and that capital budget is driven by a program that will deliver the results I just spoke
to. We don't budget based on the oil price of the day. We've got a longer term view on commodity prices, and we
set our plans based on those views, not the then-current oil price. So the fact that we're enjoying a little bit better
commodity price environment as we sit here today is not something that's going to change our capital plans or our
capital budget.

Just want to go to the chart on – excuse me, the graph on chart 13 that depicts the Permian production. And the
actual production is clearly way ahead of the type curves that you've got laid out, and that's with 16 rigs. And
conscious you're going to be going to 20 rigs. So other than Bruce Niemeyer getting a well-deserved promotion, I
was hoping that you might be able to come up with some of the factors that have led to this out-performance, and
realizing that you are not going to necessarily change the curves until at least March.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, what I would say is it's just been a focus on the fundamentals. We've used technology to do better
assessment of seismic attributes and better understand the resource. Our petrophysical modeling continues to
improve. We are using new technologies to control drill bits and improve the precision of our lateral placement.
There is a new basis of design where we change well spacing, optimize our sand concentration per stage. We
have increased the number of stages. We've got tighter perforation. There is a continual optimization process in
place.
And I will just tell you the same thing that Bruce and others have reiterated is we not only learn from what we are
doing, but we are bringing the learnings from joint venture partners and others that we see and rapidly applying
those to improve performance. So our costs are going down, our productivity is going up, our recoveries continue
to grow.
And I don't think we've seen the end of the improvement curve here. We are finding more efficiencies. Our
development costs this year are lower than our target was. Our target for – or last year they were. Our target for
2018 is lower than it was in 2017. And so we expect to see continual improvements.
For those of you that visited the Permian last year, I think you heard our people describe what they called the
Frankenwell, the perfect well. We continue to redefine what that looks like and redefine what good looks like.
So this is a story that when you match it up with our large land position, which we are optimizing, I talked about
that. And building a deeper inventory of long lateral and highly efficient acreage for us to get after the ability
through the midstream and downstream to add value and create more margin. And on top of that, you put our
royalty position, this is an asset that I expect to continue to get better. We will talk about that more when we see
you in March. And we will update some of the guidance that we've given you on what to expect.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gammel

Q

Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

I look forward to that. And as my second question, Mike, just looking at the capital allocation for 2018 to the base
upstream business relative to 2017. And this excludes the shale and tight allocations. Base business allocation is
down by about 25% year-over-year. It doesn't look like your assumptions on the base decline curve have really
changed, however. So could you talk about some of the factors that you are seeing in the base business that is
leading to the lower capital allocation with a similar expected result?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

You're right. We do have lower capital going into the base business this year. Some of that is simply driven by
what the opportunity set looks like there and what the opportunity set looks like in the Permian.
Like I said, we've done a really nice job across a lot of our producing assets in holding base decline at pretty
flattish levels. And so the efficiencies that I've talked about in the Permian are the kinds of things that we are
seeing across the entire base business.
We've taken cost out of the supply chain. We've improved the efficiency and productivity of operations. And at
times, some of the things in the base can be deepwater infill drilling, which tends to be a little bit bigger dollars.
And so as those programs ebb and flow, that can cycle that base business a little bit as well.
But we are in a range here as you look at it that says we can keep our base pretty flat at relatively manageable
capital spend. You put the Permian on top of that and you look at just the combination of those two elements and
you say, okay, we have a base load of capital that can hold our production flat or even slightly growing – base
load of capital that can keep production flat or slightly growing that is a relatively modest capital relative to the size
of our company. And so we'll talk more about the sustainability and what you can expect on that when we see you
in March.

Hey. Mike, may I add my congratulation to you. And also I just want to echo what Sankey has said, I really
appreciate you guys come on to the call from time to time. I hope that at least one of your other major competitors
will do the same.
Two questions. First, Mike, in the coming months, I will assume you're going to go and visit all your internal
people around the group. During those visits, what is the number one and number two message that you want to
send to them in terms of where you think you may need to do more effort [ph] in trusting (44:35), whether it's in
certain practice or culture, and where you want to sharpen the focus?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks, Paul, for the kind words and the question. I do intend to get out and about and see people and deliver
some messages. The first one is it's been a rough few years for people, particularly in our upstream business.
And we've weathered that storm. And so the message is simply thank you for what you've done to put us in a
position now where we are cash positive going forward without asset sales. We've taken a lot of cost out of the
business, and they worked hard to do that.

I've touched on a couple of themes already. One is we have to be prepared to win in any environment. And I think
that's particularly important as you start to see a little recovery in the oil price that we not think that the hard work
is over. We've got to focus on returns. We still have returns that need to improve. And we can't count on the
market to do that, so we've got to keep focusing on self-help, and that means we find efficiencies in everything we
do. We challenge our portfolio, some of the things I've talked about. So we've got to win in any environment.
We've got to improve returns.
I think some of the areas that are focused on are the things that really matter. And big companies can sometimes
try to do everything, and there's a few things we can focus on that will really drive performance. We need to
execute, and that means capital projects. We need to execute on cost management. We need to execute on our
safety and reliability initiatives.
And then the third one is how do we bring more technology into our business. You look around, and technology is
changing the world. We've got lots and lots of digital technology applications that are springing up all over our
business. I'd like to see that happen faster. I think there's more that we can do with technology. I think it can drive
further efficiencies in our cost structure. I think it can drive further productivity in our assets. I think it can help us
mitigate operating risks. And so I'll talk to them about how do we continue to find ways to leverage technology to
further improve performance. So those will be some of the key messages that they'll be hearing from me.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Cheng
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Okay. The second question is that on the U.S. onshore market, clearly on the long and low basis, we are seeing
cost inflation. I just want to see whether you believe your productivity gain will be more than – or that could be
fully offset, and so your unit cost will be essentially flat. And in the outside U.S, I think the service cost doesn't
seem [indiscernible] (47:25) on the spot rate is dropping. But should we assume that your overall unit cost may
still be dropping because you have other contracts maybe rolling over?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Paul, you touched on an important point. That's one of the questions a lot of people are asking us. Are we going
to see cost inflation? I'll tell you right now, as we go around the world and we engage in sourcing exercises, we
are not seeing evidence of strong cost inflation really anywhere.
Now, you mentioned the Permian. I'll come back and talk to the Permian in a minute, but we really are continuing
to find opportunities to hold or even improve costs as we look around the world.
In the Permian, there's more activity picking up, and so you can expect that there's talk of that. Two-thirds of our
spend in the Permian is protected with contracts right now. Those contracts have been negotiated before we went
into this year. We've got a philosophy of managed competition there to lock in. And with our size and leverage,
we're an attractive baseload for a number of these suppliers.
So we've locked in a good pricing – fixed index – fixed pricing in much of the portfolio. Some indexed pricing, so if
there's certain indices that move, we'll accommodate that. And then there are incentive contracts, where if some
of our service providers can meet performance benchmarks that drive our costs lower, there's some sharing of
that as well. So we're focused on ways to continue to improve our cost position there.

And the efficiencies in activity and productivity that we've seen in recent times have amplified reductions in input
costs. If you start to see input costs level out or even turn a little bit, I still expect further improvements in
productivity and efficiency will offset that. So we could see some very modest, but I'm talking single-digit overall
increase within the Permian.
But to step back to our whole portfolio, we've got growing production. And we are not going to allow cost to grow
at the rate that production is growing. And so from a unit cost standpoint, you can absolutely expect that we're still
focused on driving unit costs even lower.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Alastair R. Syme
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.

Q

Okay, brilliant. Yeah. Mike, one of your peers has recently suggested the SEC reserves are becoming a less
meaningful metric for the industry. And obviously, this is a metric that Chevron has scored very highly on in recent
years. So can I get you to offer your perspective on how you look – as you look closer into the E&P business, how
you view reserve life as a management KPI and whether you think there's an optimal reserve life for the business
to be running?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A
Yeah, so we respect the SEC's roles in the reserve process. We are very diligent in setting up our own internal
approach to reserves to be sure that we have the right checks and balances. And so I'm not going to suggest the
SEC reserves rules are anything but something that we understand and comply with. And they are, I think, a
consistent benchmark for investors to use to evaluate companies. And so, like many things, you can argue are
they perfect or not, but it's a consistent benchmark and we all use it. So I think it's useful.
I believe stability in reserve life is good. If you see reserve life growing, it's either a sign that your production is
declining or that you're investing prematurely or too much. If you see the reverse, where reserve life is declining, it
starts to raise questions about sustainability, about the need to go out and spend money to acquire a resource.
And so to me, stability is the key. We've had a good stable R-over-P ratio here for the last many years, and
continue to add our reserves primarily through organic activity. I talked about the reserve adds this year being
driven by the Permian and Gorgon. Those are big contributors, and those are certainly contributors that we can
see out into the future, we would expect to play a part in extending reserves life as we go forward. So, I think each
company has got their on particular set of circumstances, and I'll only comment on ours. I think we're in a good,
strong, and sustainable reserves position.

question please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Blake Fernandez
Analyst, Scotia Howard Weil

Q

First, good morning, and, Mike, congratulations as well. Back, I guess, right on that reserves topic. Maybe, Pat,
this is a question for you. But given the nice increase that you saw this year, is it fair to think that DD&A rates
have potential to kind of move lower as a result of that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yes, I do believe that. I don't have an order of magnitude for you at the moment because we are just finalizing
that. You'll note that the numbers we put out are preliminary, and we're tying that down between now and when
we publish the 10-K later in February. But yes, directionally, that will happen. We will have lower DD&A rates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Blake Fernandez
Analyst, Scotia Howard Weil

Q

Perfect. The second question is on the, I guess, recent discoveries you've had. Both look pretty attractive and
then look like they have fast-track potential. Given the focus on short cycle the past 12 to 18 months or so,
obviously, you haven't sanctioned many projects, but these look promising. I guess I'm just trying to understand
the timing of when you could look at sanctioning that and how that would fall into the capital program. And I guess
what I'm thinking there specifically is phasing with Tengiz. As Tengiz rolls off, could this kind of make their way in
and hopefully not create a step-change in total spending?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, we're really still appraising these discoveries. And they are encouraging, and we're very pleased with the
first look and the proximity to infrastructure. But I think it's really premature to jump into exactly when and how
those would be developed, other than the proximity to infrastructure does open up more capital-efficient
development alternatives. And you'd see if you were distant from it.
But more work to be done to be sure that these have been fully characterized. I think to get above that a little bit, I
would just say that we really believe that a more ratable C&E program is important. I think it helps us financially. I
think it helps us from a standpoint of execution. And so, I think that the swings you've seen in our C&E spend are
things that we'll try to significantly dampen out and stay in a more ratable band.
The last thing I would say is no matter how good this resource looks and how interesting it is, we've got a great
option in our shale and tight portfolio. And other resource classes in Gulf of Mexico deepwater is a great example
of that need to get the costs down in order to compete for funding. Our people know that's what they need to do to
make these competitive within our portfolio for funding. And that's why I think the brownfield aspect of these is
interesting. But they have to compete, and they have to deliver attractive returns and economics relative to our
other alternatives.

please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan Todd
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

Great, thanks. Maybe another one on capital allocation. I mean, post the tax reform, does the tax reform in the
U.S. impact the way that you think about investment at all over the next five years either from – in terms of an
increase in cash flow or from an improved rate of return from associated or particular projects? Or should we think
that you will generally continue to err on the side of capital constraint? I guess, how – does it figure at all in terms
of how you look at allocating capital over the next five years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

We are still grinding through the real details of our specific position. And these are – companies like ours have
complex tax positions. And so, to get too specific about that, it's probably premature.

I would say that it makes U.S. assets and investments more attractive because they are going to be attracting a
lower tax rate. And so I think over time, as I said earlier, I think it's good for the U.S. economy. I think it's good for
U.S. companies. I think it's good for investment in this country. And we have significant assets here already and
opportunities to invest in the future. So, we will grind through all of that, and make sure that we get a clear
understanding and guidance.
The other thing, if you think about it through the other lens, is as we have assets around the world, some in fiscal
regimes that have not changed for quite some time, whether it's in response to lower prices or the changes in the
U.S. tax laws, those investments become tougher to make, frankly.
And so I think the other thing is governments around the world will over time have to evaluate the competitiveness
of their fiscal terms relative to the options that a company like ours would have. We allocate our capital to drive
better returns across a global portfolio. And so as these things move around, it's a competitive world and we need
to acknowledge that, as do others.

Ryan Todd

Q

Great. Thanks. And then maybe a follow-up on the Permian. You've been relatively active, and you have a slide in
there on acreage sales that you've done over the past few years and expectations for 2018. If you think about that
program, is it – I mean, would you characterize it as more of an effort to core up your position or is it an effort to
pull forward, to some extent, kind of the long-term tail of the valuation, a mix of both? And I guess kind of given
your expectation of going to 20 rigs at year-end, you clearly have a very, very, very long resource life there. I
mean, how should we think about your philosophy in terms of maximizing the value of the asset? Could you
monetize more in terms of monetizing some of the tail or accelerating rig count? I mean, how do you look at
maximization of the value of that resource?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. It's a good question. The real goal is to maximize the value of the resource position. And the largest driver
by a significant amount is coring up acreage so that we can get longer laterals and the efficiencies that we
continue to see out of our operations. I mentioned we understand the resource much better today than we did 12
months ago and 24 months ago. And I think we will understand the resource better 12 months from now as we
continue to use more and more sophisticated tools, and gain more experience and insights into what makes it
work.
So, as you have that kind of knowledge and you've got a large land position, we would intend to drive our portfolio
to what we believe are the sweetest of the sweet spots and the positions that will create the most value over time.
If that means some of it is what you would describe as further back in the queue, and the right thing to do is
simply to exit it for cash and redeploying into coring up today, that's certainly a part of it. But it's a value-driven
strategy and it's to say, okay, how do we get the most value out of the 2 million acres that we have there. And so
it's not driven by any intent to sell the tail alone. It's really to create value across the whole position.

Mike, if I could follow up a little bit on Ryan's question, you kind of talked about the Permian position there. Is it
easier, the same, or more difficult to do the swaps and exchanges? In other words, as everyone gets more
comfortable with what they own or are we seeing it where people are less certain what they own, and it's slowing
down some of the exchanges? I know you had like kind of a 200,000-acre, 80,000 acres done so far. Just curious
how that's progressing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

What I would say, Roger, is this is one of those unique places where you can drive win-wins. And because of the
way the acreage was defined over 100 years ago and the way it's been held over time, and the technology today
with these longer laterals and the value creation through that kind of a development program, it's in everybody's
best interest to find ways to improve their position. And oftentimes, in commercial negotiations, you've got a winlose. And that can create a tougher dynamic than one where both parties can realize value. And you sit down at
the table and both really have incentives to find a way to do a deal.
So, I would say, we may, in fact, have been a little more difficult to deal with heretofore simply because of our let's
go slow to really understand what we've got approach to this. And whether you're talking development or you're
talking land optimization, there's a lot of activity going on in the basin where we weren't necessarily engaged in as
much of it. Now, that we're in a position where we feel like we really understand what we want and where we want
to go, and we're willing to deal, we've got numerous conversations underway with counterparties. And I think
there's strong reason to believe that we'll conclude further value creating transactions this year and into the future.
