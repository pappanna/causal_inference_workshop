Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to
Chevron's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-andanswer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference
call is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation,
Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

All right. Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the
call with me today is Mark Nelson, Vice President, Midstream, Strategy & Policy. Also joining us on the call are
Frank Mount and Wayne Borduin, who are currently transitioning in the role of General Manager of Investor
Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement here on slide 2.
Turning to slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. The company's first-quarter earnings were $3.6
billion, or $1.90 per diluted share. Earnings excluding foreign exchange and special items were also $3.6 billion. A
reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange and other non-GAAP measures can be found in an appendix
to this presentation.
This is our strongest earnings result since the third quarter of 2014 when Brent prices were above $100. For the
current quarter, Brent prices averaged $67 per barrel.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $5 billion. Excluding working capital effects, cash flow from
operations was $7.1 billion.
At quarter end, debt balances stood at approximately $40 billion, which resulted in a headline debt ratio of 20.9%
and a net debt ratio of 18.1%.
During the first quarter we paid $2.1 billion in dividends. We currently yield 3.6%.
Turning to slide 4. We are on track to deliver on our 2018 cash generation guidance from our recent analyst
meeting. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital effects, grew to $7.1 billion. Positive impacts from
strong realizations and high-margin volume growth were partially offset by equity affiliate dividends that were
about $1 billion lower than equity affiliate earnings.
Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $3 billion, approximately $300 million or 10% below first quarter
2017, as we continue to complete our major capital projects under construction and drive improved capital
efficiency across our portfolio. The result, free cash flow, excluding working capital effects, was $4.2 billion,
approximately $2.5 billion higher than the average quarter in 2017.
Asset sale proceeds within the quarter were minimal. However, with the closing in April of the Elk Hills transaction
and the anticipated closing of the sale of our Southern Africa downstream business later this year, we remain on
track for asset sale proceeds of $1 billion to $3 billion in 2018.
Turning to slide 5. As many of you are aware, working capital effects impacts our business unevenly throughout
the year. These impacts are to a large degree transitory. Because of this uneven pattern by quarter, many of you
exclude working capital impacts from your models.
However, while uneven by quarter, our pattern is fairly consistent year to year. The chart, drawn from this
decade's average working capital impacts, demonstrates the pattern.
Normally, working capital is a cash penalty in the first and second quarters, followed by a cash benefit in the third
and fourth quarters. The variation has at times been two to three times the quarterly averages shown.
This rhythm is fairly consistent and mainly results from seasonal inventory builds and draws, as well as the timing
of supplier, JV partner, and tax payments.
We anticipate this year's pattern to be no different. If price levels generally hold where they are today, we expect a
majority of the $2.1 billion of working capital consumed during the first quarter to be released throughout the
remainder of the year. The residual is expected to be mostly receivables related to both higher prices and higher
production compared to 2017.
Turning to slide 6, first quarter 2018 results were approximately $950 million higher than first quarter 2017.
Special items, primarily the absence of a first quarter 2017 gain from the sale of our Indonesian geothermal
assets, coupled with a first quarter 2018 U.S. upstream asset impairment, decreased earnings by $720 million
between periods. A swing in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings between the periods by $370 million.
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased around $2.2 billion between the
periods, mainly on improved realizations and higher lifting. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and
foreign exchange, decreased by about $255 million, mostly due to an unfavorable swing in timing effects and
lower volumes, largely from the sale of our Canadian asset.
The variance in the Other segment was primarily the result of the absence of prior year's favorable corporate tax
items. As we indicated previously, our guidance for the Other segment is $2.4 billion in annual net charges,
though quarterly results are likely to be non-ratable.
Turning now to slide 7, a beautiful chart, if I do say so myself. This compares results for the first quarter of 2018
with fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter results were approximately $530 million higher than the fourth quarter.
Special items, mainly from the absence of the fourth quarter 2017 U.S. tax reform gain, decreased earnings
between periods by approximately $2 billion, while a swing in foreign exchange impact increased earnings by
$225 million between the periods.
Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by around $1.4 billion between
quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations and liftings along with lower depreciation and operating expenses.
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, improved by about $540 million, reflecting
higher earnings from CPChem, mainly due to the absence of fourth quarter 2017 hurricane impacts along with
improved refining and marketing margins.
The variance in the Other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges and a favorable swing in corporate tax
items between quarters.
Turning now to slide 8, first quarter production was 2.852 million barrels a day, an increase of 4.5% over average
2017 production and within our guidance range for 2018. This production level represents an all-time quarterly
high for the company. Growth is expected to continue during 2018 with Wheatstone Train 2 coming online; major
capital projects such as Wheatstone, Hebron, and Stampede ramping up; and, continued growth in our shale and
tight assets.
During the quarter, the impact of asset sales on production was negligible. In the second quarter, we forecast a
quarterly asset sale impact of around 15,000 barrels per day, mainly from our recent Elk Hills and Democratic
Republic of the Congo transactions. We'll also start our planned turnaround activity in the second quarter. Our fullyear production guidance remains unchanged at 4% to 7% growth over 2017, excluding the impact of asset sales.
On slide 9, first quarter 2018 production was an increase of 176,000 barrels a day or 6.6% from first quarter 2017.
Major capital projects increased production by 228,000 barrels a day, as we started and ramped up multiple
projects, including Gorgon and Wheatstone. Shale and tight production increased 101,000 barrels a day, mainly
due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian.
Base declines, net of production from new wells, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria, were 39,000
barrels a day. The impact of 2017 asset sales, mainly in the U.S. Mid-continent, Gulf of Mexico, and South
Natuna Sea, reduced production by 61,000 barrels a day. Entitlement effects reduced production by 50,000
barrels a day, as rising prices and lower spend reduced cost recovery barrels.
Turning to slide 10, Gorgon and Wheatstone delivered strong and reliable performance in the first quarter. First
quarter net production was 202,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Gorgon and 67,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day from Wheatstone. We shipped 69 LNG and 4 condensate cargos and were able to take
advantage of rising oil-linked prices as well as strong Asia LNG spot prices, which averaged over $10 per BOE for
the quarter.
We continue to fine tune the plants to enhance reliability and boost capacity. These efforts are yielding favorable
results. Gorgon first quarter production is more than 5% higher than our previous best quarter. And Wheatstone
Train 1 has been running well. We have a planned pit stop on Gorgon Train 2 next month to replicate
performance improvement modifications that we have made in the other two trains.
And work on Wheatstone Train 2 is progressing well, and commissioning activities are ongoing. The warm end is
expected to be ready for startup, shortly, and we're expecting to begin LNG production this quarter. Dom
[domestic] gas is expected to start up late in the third quarter.
Turning to the Permian, Permian shale and tight production in the first quarter was up about 100,000 barrels a
day, or 65% relative to the same quarter last year. Looking forward, we forecast Permian unconventional growth
of 30% to 40% annually through 2020. All of this is premised on running 20 company operated and approximately
9 net rigs on NOJV [non-operated join venture] properties by yearend.
In March, we guided to 2% to 3% annual growth from our base plus shale and tight business through 2022 at a $9
billion to $10 billion of annual capital spend.
We are currently running 17 rigs and expect to stand up our 18th company operated rig next month.
We also continue creating value through land transactions. We executed nine deals swapping approximately
25,000 acres in the first quarter. And we have several others under negotiation. As you know these laterals
enable high value longer laterals.
We often get questions about our Permian takeaway capacity, as well as other questions on the industry macro
environment. Mark heads up our Midstream and Strategy groups and will provide some additional insights. Over
to you, Mark.

Mark A. Nelson

Thanks, Pat. As Pat mentioned, we get questions these days about Permian-related differentials, the long-term oil
market, and LNG supply and demand.
So turning to slide 12, let's continue with the Permian story, where we believe optimizing the value chain from
wellhead to customer differentiates Chevron from many in the business.
As you know, our advantage starts with our land position and our factory [ph] and people (12:36). And continues
with the market knowledge of each barrel's value at any point in time and ends with the ability to appropriately
place those barrels.
For example, recent crude differentials in the Midland Basin have widened. And we've secured flow and
preserved margin by proactively procuring enough capacity to move product to multiple market centers,
negotiating highly competitive transportation rates, batching and blending to meet market demands and avoid
price discounts, and by accessing the best world markets for each barrel with our export capabilities.
Simply said, our goal is to maximize the return on every Permian molecule.
Another question that is often asked is reflected on slide 13, and that is what role does oil play in meeting the
world's growing energy demand in the decades to come? In developing our point of view, as you would expect,
we use detailed internal and external analysis to evaluate supply/demand scenarios and the associated
opportunities and risks in our business.
Our macro liquids view is similar to a number of independent assessments. And we're showing one of these
assessments, the IEA new policy scenario in the upper right. We believe that oil demand will continue to grow for
the foreseeable future. And the need for incremental supply continues to exist in any realistic scenario.
Reinforcing this view, today's liquids demand continues to be in the higher end of most independent forecasts.
The chart on the bottom right illustrates another of our points of view. We believe in a longer, flatter supply curve.
Despite the recent run-up in prices we believe capital discipline, cost management, and market signpost will
always matter. And we are well positioned to win in any environment, given our advantaged portfolio.
Turning to page 12 (sic) [14] and the macro LNG view, this graph reflects the latest LNG demand projections from
Wood Mackenzie with their supply forecasts. Highlighting that the LNG market is becoming oversupplied in the
short term, as new projects continue to ramp up in both the Pacific and Atlantic basins.
North Asian LNG demand, however, especially in China, was stronger last winter than the market anticipated. In
fact, 2017 Chinese gas demand was up 15% year on year with LNG imports up 46%. While this growth rate may
moderate, the demand drivers appear mostly sustainable with coal to gas switching in residential and industrial
applications mandated by the Chinese government to reduce air pollution.
So the LNG market should rebalance with a supply gap expected to open before the middle of the next decade.
And this is where Gorgon and Wheatstone capacity creep and debottlenecking opportunities will fit very nicely.
Only the most competitive – cost competitive projects will be able to move forward in this space. And we will be
very disciplined with our investment and will fund only those projects that will generate top returns.
With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Pat.

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

All right, let me close this out here. On slide 15, I'd like to reiterate some of our key messages from our recent
security analyst meeting and to demonstrate how we're delivering on those commitments.
First, our cash generation improvement trend continues and is in line with previous guidance. In the first quarter,
2018 cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, was $7.1 billion, well in excess of our cash capital
expenditures and quarterly dividend commitment.
Second, we are executing a disciplined C&E program, allocating capital to the highest return projects that
compete in our portfolio.
Third, we grew production by 4.5% from full year 2017 to 2.85 million barrels a day, achieving an all-time quarterly
high for the company and trending well within guidance.
Fourth, we have an advantaged portfolio in the Permian Basin that is delivering on all cylinders. Year on year we
added 100,000 barrels per day of shale and tight production here, trending ahead of recent guidance. And we are
leveraging our midstream business to maximize the returns on every molecule.
And lastly but very importantly, we increased the dividend per share by 4%, delivering on our number one
financial priority to shareholders.
So that concludes our prepared remarks. And Mark and I are now ready to take your questions. Please keep in
mind that we have a full queue and try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if necessary. And we'll
certainly do our best to try to get all of your questions answered.
Jonathan, go ahead and open the lines, please.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION

Q

Pat, really great quarter just in terms of demonstrating the cash generation potential that Chevron has moving
forward. And so, I guess we actually get to the high-quality question about what you would potentially do with
discretionary cash flow. In the capital program, it's obviously very disciplined. It's within a fairly tight range.
Balance sheet is about where you want it to be. That kind of leads us to share buybacks. And what would you
potentially need to see to begin a repurchase program?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Jason, thanks for the question and thanks for acknowledging the good quarter. I think at this particular point
in time our messaging around share repurchases really haven't changed from what we said just a few short six
weeks or so ago. And at that time, we said we wanted to see the cash flow actually materialize. We said we
wanted to see prices sustained a little bit.
We do fundamentally believe that it is our fourth priority. And dividend growth is number one; feeding the business
is number two; the balance sheet, as you say, is number three; and then surplus cash. Once we've satisfied all
those other commitments, turns into a share repurchase program.
It is part of the value proposition that we have offered shareholders in the past. As you know, 10 out of the last 14
years we have had share repurchases. And we only stopped them during the financial crisis, and then in the last
three years when prices had their collapse.
So it's very much a part of our thinking these days. And when we re-inaugurate it, if the circumstances permit that,
we want to be able to do so in a sustainable fashion.

Q

Appreciate those comments, Pat. Maybe just as my follow-up, one for Mark. Mark, you mentioned that the
debottlenecking at Gorgon and Wheatstone would be towards the low end of the cost curve in the LNG supply
stack. Do you see anything else in the portfolio that would potentially be competitive? And I guess, I might even
be referring specifically to expansion trains at either one of those projects.

Mark A. Nelson

A

Vice President-Midstream, Strategy & Policy, Chevron Corp.

Well, I think – great question, Jason. I think from an Asia LNG perspective, the most exciting thing for us, of
course, is the amount of demand that we're seeing in that part of the world. And it's probably premature for us to
be thinking about extra trains, as we have considerable opportunity moving from both ramp up to debottlenecking.
And having spent much of my career around refineries, I wouldn't underestimate the opportunity there and the
size of prize.
So we're focused on ramp up, efficient operation, and then building our way into leveraging the existing
infrastructure in Australia. And so, thanks for the question.

Paul Cheng

Q

Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Hey, guys. Good morning. I have two questions, I think that for – both of them for Mark. How much is the oil
production from Permian that you are selling inside Permian in the first quarter? And what is your ticket weight
capacity for the next couple years? Have you already locked in sufficient, according to your current growth plan?
And also, we have heard some people talking about gas handling in the basin may start to become an issue.
Want to see what is your view on that. So that's the first one.
[ph] As well (21:09), the second one is on the LNG market. Want to see whether you guys have been actively
marketing or trying to market additional gas. And what's the conversation with the customer this day? And what's
the bid/ask differences, if there's any?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark A. Nelson
Vice President-Midstream, Strategy & Policy, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks, Paul. Thinking about – and I'll answer – I'll address your Permian takeaway capacity questions kind of at
the high level, as you can imagine.
We're very comfortable with our off-take positions today. And it goes all the way back to that advantaged portfolio
and, maybe equally importantly, disciplined development. So it allows us to keep up with our production. And we
do that by partnering with our strong infrastructure companies. And we get highly competitive rates. And then,
they execute on infrastructure projects that, quite frankly, might not compete in our portfolio.
And we view that as activating our value chain at the lowest possible capital investments, which is kind of a return
driven mentality. We will hit moments of tightness and length, but we like our position moving forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Cheng
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q
How about the gas handling?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark A. Nelson

A

Vice President-Midstream, Strategy & Policy, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, so from a gas perspective, all three streams – so oil, gas, and NGLs – all must flow in the Permian. And as
you know, the oil tends to drive the economics, but we have flow assurance across all three streams today. And
again, we're comfortable with our position looking forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Cheng

Q

Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

But do you believe the basin as a whole will have a problem, if not Chevron?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark A. Nelson

A

Vice President-Midstream, Strategy & Policy, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, from a basin perspective, you certainly have – as we've all read the news, you can see some competitors,
who perhaps don't have either the same discipline or the same advantaged portfolio, experiencing problems. But
in the Permian, in general, most of those would be temporal. We see that as a region that will solve those type of
problems and only have kind of temporal challenges.
On your LNG marketing question, as you know, we've chosen to do business with some of the kind of largest,
most reliable customers in that part of the world. And we have long term contracts. And those – the natural
discussions that go on about wanting reliability and the best sustainable price continues, as we would have
expected. So we're seeing customers continuing to like the reliability that we've been able to deliver and our
flexibility in helping them with some of their operating challenges. So from our perspective, we see those
relationships remaining very strong.

please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Hey, good morning, guys, and congrats on a good quarter. My first question is just related to cost inflation across
the portfolio, if you're seeing any early signs of costs increasing? And any comments, specifically, international
versus U.S.?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. Yeah. I think that, by and large, the more material cost pressures that we have seen have been limited to
the Permian and the U.S. unconventional market.
The rest of the world, we're beginning to see some cost pressures, but not of the same – it's really as though the
future rates of decline in the rest of the world probably have stopped. And so, you're probably leveling out there,
so you're beginning to see a little tension there. Whereas in the Permian, you are actually beginning to see cost
increases.
I'd like to take a moment, though, and acknowledge that we're largely protected in our Permian cost structure this
year because of the contracting strategies that we have followed. And this is, again, one of the benefits of having
a 20-rig program that has been long planned, and we're well disciplined around it. It has allowed us to line out all
of these services and contract arrangements that we have needed well in advance.
And so, we have about two-thirds of our spending this year that's either occurring at known prices or index costs
or have cost containment capabilities built into them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta

Q

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

And thanks, Pat. The follow-up question is, just how do you get comfortable as a management team that the
company is not under investing? One of your peers is out taking a much more aggressive approach around
capital spend over the next couple of years.
And I guess one of the things that we hear when people push back on our view on the company is that the fear is
that you're in harvest mode right now. But we're going to go into early next decade, and what are the projects that
will drive the next wedge of ultimately cash flow growth that enables you to replenish the portfolio and offset the
decline. But so, wanted you to respond to that narrative, because it's out there in the market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. I think the primary thing that I would say is we're not after volume growth for volume growth's sake. We're
after growing value.
And we have a tremendous portfolio here. We showed a slide back in March that had 40 years of 2P resource
development opportunity. And it's very attractive resource that can be developed at relatively modest capital
investment program.
So we feel very comfortable about the portfolio that we have. And individually, we've got line of sight in the
unconventional growth between now and into 2022. And then in 2022 we see TCOs, the TCO WPMP-FGP project
first production coming online.
So for the next several years we've got line of sight on very good growth and frankly, a portfolio that allows growth
beyond that.

Morning, Doug.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate

Q

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So I'll take my two as well if I may, Pat. I'm afraid that I'm going to open up
with a buyback question again, just go back to that very quickly.
Just philosophically, I'm guessing buybacks are not something you'd want to chop around quarter to quarter. So I
guess my question is, what level of – what would management need to see to be comfortable to commence a
buyback program, assuming you would need that to be ratable? And I'm thinking about level of cash on the
balance sheet, whether quarter to quarter what we're seeing is a function of cash tax payments and interest
charges and so on. At what point would you be comfortable to say, okay, now we're ready to get going with this?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. I mean it's hard to – I don't want to put a quantification on this at this point, because I don't want to kind of
get ahead of the internal thinking on this.
But clearly, we would have to have sustainability and a view of surplus cash generation beyond the $18 billion to
$20 billion capital program that we want to fund, beyond the growth rate that we anticipate around dividends. And
as you say, our balance sheet is hovering in a very reasonable place at the moment.
So we have to have a view of sustainability. And when I say sustainability, I don't just mean this quarter to next
quarter to maybe the third quarter out. But I really mean over a series of years.
So we would like to be able to kind of average in, dollar average in the cost of that share repurchase program,
because we do have some shareholders who are not in favor of share repurchases, because of the concept that
you only do them when you have the cash available, and when you have the cash available, your stock price is
high. So the way that we can mitigate that is by having a very sustainable share repurchase program.
So it really comes down to the longer term, or I'll say medium term, generation – cash generation capability of the
firm and expectations around that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

I appreciate that and so that makes a lot of sense. I'm guessing the dividend takes a priority, as you've said
previously.

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Absolutely.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate

Q

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

So my follow-up is just a quick one. Obviously, you had a tremendous quarter relative to what the Street was
expecting. And when you look through the presentation, there was a couple of comments in there about liftings in
Other, both U.S. and international. Can you just talk a little bit about what that was? Because was there some
favorable timing issues in terms of sales versus production? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, I mean actually for the first quarter, we were slightly under lifted. So I think it's just a variance between the
position of this quarter versus the prior quarter, very modest there.
I think part of the earnings improvement, or the earnings beat that you might be highlighting really relates to
depreciation. And in particular if you'll recall back, we had a 155% reserve replacement ratio in 2017. And that
obviously allows you to, as you go forward, to lower your DD&A rate per barrel.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil M. Gresh

Q

Hey, thanks, and good morning. First question is a bit of a follow-up to Neil's just around the growth outlook
through 2025. You do have some capital spending that will be rolling off after this year, Wheatstone and some
other things. How do you think about where that wedge of – assuming you're going to keep a CapEx cap in place
through 2020 as promised. How do you think about where that extra cash flow might go between, say, adding
more rigs in the Permian versus something like Gulf of Mexico, where a peer of yours just sanctioned a project
with a $35 breakeven proposition?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


A

Yeah, I think that we really feel good about sticking to the 20-rig program in the Permian. We think there is still
opportunity to lower development cost, lower operating cost there, and maximize revenue streams out of that. So
that will be a primary area of focus for us, getting really good efficiency out of that particular asset.
If I think about other areas where there could be small incremental money spent, it would be really around the
appraisal and pre-feed, pre-engineering work perhaps in the Gulf of Mexico. We have four potential areas of
interest there – or they're areas of potential interest, I guess I should say, Anchor, Tigris, Ballymore, and Whale.
And so that would be areas where we would look to do further evaluation.
I should also mention that the development activity around other shales other than Permian, so in the Marcellus,
in Kaybob Duvernay, in Vaca Muerta, that could like – those areas could likely pick up additional capital
investment.

Got it, okay. And just one question on...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. Look, can I just go back and mention one thing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil M. Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

With regard to Deepwater, so that people don't misinterpret what I'm saying here, we do have multiple
opportunities that we can evaluate. But we would be very disciplined and very ratable, be working on the pacing
of any sort of development that we would do there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil M. Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Right, so the commitment to the $20 billion cap. Just one question on the quarter. One of your peers on cash
flows reported a flip in their deferred tax from a headwind to a tailwind at these higher price levels. I was just
wondering, you mentioned the $1 billion headwind in the quarter from affiliates earnings versus distributions,
which is about half of the headwind you're expecting for the entire year. Just curious if deferred tax played out as
you expected?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. I would say directionally, deferred tax played out as we were expecting. We did have – it is influenced, as
you might expect, by the timing of when you place assets in service and when you get bonus depreciation.

In regard to the overall set of headwinds, I had given guidance back in March of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion as the
headwinds for the year. But I had said at the time that we thought working capital would be nil. I would say if
prices hold where they are today, there will be a little bit of a penalty in working capital, as I mentioned in my
prepared remarks. So you may want to think towards the – certainly activity trending towards the higher end of
that range that I gave you.
I will say this is very hard for us to predict though. And so, I do want to reserve the right every quarter to come
back and give you an update.

please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Guy Baber
Analyst, Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.

Q

Thanks for taking the question. Pat, I wanted to stick on the cash flow here a little bit. But the $7.1 billion in preworking capital cash flow seemed to be better than the framework you all gave at the Analyst Day when we adjust
for commodity price. And I understand that 1Q is typically weaker, given downstream seasonality and the affiliate
dividend timing.
So I just wanted to confirm that outperformance versus the internal plan. And was wondering if you could isolate
some of the key drivers of that better than expected cash flow? What sticks out to you all internally?
And then with Brent at these higher levels here, just as a check, do the general sensitivities you all have given still
hold? Or do we need to rethink those a little bit?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, so, Guy, I'd say that the first quarter was really a very clean quarter. And it's a good basis I would say for
you to build into your models going forward.
I think we are running a little bit ahead perhaps on the guidance that we gave. But I think first quarter is a good
benchmark for you there.
And the sensitivity that we had given for $1 of improvement for Brent on earnings on cash flow is about [ph] $450
million (35:09) – excuse me, on earnings it's a little less than that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Guy Baber
Analyst, Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.

Q

That's helpful. Thanks. And then, I had a follow-up for Mark. So appreciate the view on the macro oil landscape
here. Can you just talk a little bit maybe about what your base case expectations are from a high level when you
think about this decline in long cycle capital investment that's taken place for the industry over the last few years?
So from 2013 to 2018, we've tallied up about 2 million barrels a day of major project capacity that started up per
year, on average. And then, that drops to around only 1 million barrels a day from 2019 to 2022 or so.

So is the Chevron view – I mean, do you see something similar? Do you see a supply gap emerging for the
industry on the oil side over the next few years? And when might you see that beginning to show up in
supply/demand balances?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark A. Nelson

A

Vice President-Midstream, Strategy & Policy, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Guy. Well, so first, and from a short-term perspective, obviously, we've hit a space where the markets
rebalanced. And that's on the back of some fairly solid demand, in fact, demand that has surprised folks – most
folks to the upside, and effective curtailment or planned or unplanned declines in certain countries around the
world on top of geopolitics. So that's all short-term price support for today.
We're not designing our business on these kind of prices. We're driving our business for a lower for longer
assumption. And I think we're coming from a time where we're practiced at production coming from large
investments versus short cycle activity. And as an industry, we do not forecast that as well as we do the large
projects.
So we have a perpetual supply gap, obviously. That's the industry that we're in. But I would expect prices to stay
in a fairly tight range over time. And we're going to design our business to deal with the lower end of those
assumptions.

Q

Pat, I wanted to go back. You had mentioned the equity affiliate headwinds, and you kind of addressed that. I
guess what I was thinking, specifically, is on TCO. Is there an oil price level that you would actually begin to start
getting distribution from that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Actually, Blake, we do still get distributions. It really is a determination that's made by the partnership council. It is
not solely within Chevron's control.
But the partnership council folks take a look at what are their requirements for funding the project that's under
development. They took a look at what cash generation has been. They take a look at what the partners' dividend
interests are and will negotiate, basically, to a dividend declaration.
And they can do that. They review that multiple times during the course of the year. And they can do one dividend
a year, or they can do a couple dividends a year. It's really the partnership council.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Blake Fernandez

Q

Analyst, Scotia Howard Weil

Okay. So it sounds like there is some flexibility and potentially could increase, dependent on what oil prices do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

There is. And we had a dividend last year. Expectations are for a dividend this year as well. So again, it's not
anything that we control uniquely within Chevron.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Blake Fernandez

Q

Analyst, Scotia Howard Weil

Okay. The second question, I'll just take advantage of Mark being on the call. But the 25,000 acres in the Permian
that were transacted, it sounds like it was a swap. So I just wanted to confirm that your acreage position hasn't
really changed overall.
But I guess I was under the impression that a lot of those transactions had already come to fruition, and you all
were kind of done. So are you still in the process of kind of marketing and coring up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark A. Nelson

A

Vice President-Midstream, Strategy & Policy, Chevron Corp.

Thank you very much. So you're right. Mostly swaps were discussed in the materials that you saw. And, never
done, would be my answer in regard to potentially looking for ways to get longer laterals in the marketplace. From
our perspective, we won't stop looking. And we believe it's created considerable value for that kind of disciplined
execution that we talked about. And in fact, I would expect more transactions in the future in this space.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

And I would just add, swaps are often kind of hard to put together, just because you're trying to – both parties
optimize. So they may take a little bit longer duration to come to fruition.

please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan Todd
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

Great, thanks. Maybe a first quick one on the Permian. Congrats on a great quarter. I think you guys may have
blown out the Midland differential all by yourselves there.
Can you talk a little bit about – obviously, there's some timing issues here. But what drove some of the drivers of
the particularly strong quarter-on-quarter performance in the Permian, whether it was from particular areas,
number of completions, and how to think about the trajectory of that going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure, Ryan. Basically, we had a large increase in the quarter, because we put several wells on production at the
very tail end of 2017. We also saw increased NOJV activity. And the last point that I would make is that there can
be – it can be lumpy. The production increases that we show can be lumpy. So I wouldn't necessarily have you
think that the increase from fourth to first quarter is something that would be repeatable or ratable, necessarily.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan Todd
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

Great. Thanks. And then, maybe, we haven't talked about IMO 2020. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how
you think about your relative positioning into it? And whether you would envision – or how you think about the
attractiveness of any potential investments to take advantage of the situation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, I think the short answer is really that Chevron's position is pretty well placed. We're well positioned. We
have complex refineries, and we produce more distillates than fuel oil. We don't really produce much fuel oil in the
U.S. We do have some exposure there around Asia.
But the kind of the situation we've got from a refining capacity standpoint, as well as the fact that we've got
midstream and trading capacity that we can optimize over the course of what we think will be an unstable market
here as this rationalizes out, puts us we think in a pretty good position.
It's a little hard to understand exactly what the impacts are. So we continue to monitor what the industry response
is going to be and what the actions are to be taken by the various parties there.
It's kind of an unusual regulation in the sense that there's no single actor that's tagged with compliance. So there's
multiple ways that compliance can occur. It can occur on the part of the shippers. Or it can occur on the part of
the refiners. So it's a little hard to understand exactly how compliance will take place.

Q

Hey, jumping in, since I've got you, Mark and Pat, on here, as we think about your ability to capture whatever
differential exists between the Gulf Coast and the Permian, how should we think about that as flowing through
your business? The reason I'm asking, Pat, is thinking about, is it a realization and so we'll see it in the upstream
part there? Or does it flow through somewhere else?
Just trying to maybe head off at the pass concerns that in coming quarters realizations could look weak, but the
overall number is fine. So how does it flow through on your upstream business?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

It would come through the upstream, upstream realization.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read

Q

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Okay, so whether it's commercial pipeline or whatever other capture, it'll all stay in the upstream side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

That's correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read

Q

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Okay. And then switching gears, just since you put the chart up there with the longer flatter supply curve. You've
talked a little bit earlier about some of the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater opportunities. Price-wise, it looks like
Deepwater non-OPEC would be in the money here. So how do you think about when you're comfortable moving
forward with an FID as you complete your studies on those various projects?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark A. Nelson

A

Vice President-Midstream, Strategy & Policy, Chevron Corp.

Pat, I'll start. So it's about priorities from our perspective in capital allocation. So the good news of having a
portfolio that's so strong with the unconventionals, with short cycle, high return investments, it makes all of the
other projects have to compete to be brought forward.
And I've heard Jay Johnson say numerous times, the idea of changing outcomes and improving returns – and
when you target a group of engineers on making a project have higher economics, it's amazing what can be
developed for us to consider. So, Pat, would you like to add to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. Yeah, so I'd just say, I mean first opportunity we've got obviously is infill drilling and keeping existing
facilities fully loaded here. And to the extent that there's a Deepwater – a new reservoir found that can tie into
existing facilities, obviously that's – the economics there would be stronger.
But we're working to get the development costs of Greenfield down significantly. So standardizing on surface
facilities, design one, build many, standardizing along with the industry on subsea kit. We're also in a mode here
now where we would be designing the production facility, perhaps not for peak production, but for the best capital
efficiency. So longer subsea laterals.
There's just an awful lot that we think we can do in the Deepwater area to continue to get development costs
down. But we have to see that actually materialize before we would be in a position to take an FID.
We have a number of opportunities that are being evaluated I'd say at this particular point in time. And I can't
really say which one is going to rise to the top first. But it's nice to have activity underway there, and we're making
good progress.

Theepan Jothilingam

Q

Managing Director, Exane BNP Paribas

Just one question actually, coming back to the LNG performance. Could you talk about, just in terms of production
both at Wheatstone and Gorgon, how sustainable it is to produce above that nameplate capacity?
And just a follow-up question to that would be, could you remind us in terms of the volumes from those two
projects, is all of it on long term contracts? Or has there been some opportunities to, let's say, optimize some of
that volume through pricing arbitrage? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay, yeah, I would say we have been spending time and effort and taking these pit stops in order to improve the
reliability for example at Gorgon.
We do think there's opportunity over time to expand capacity through debottlenecks and gain more capacity and
gain more efficiency. So we're willing to make investments now to get to a certain reliability and efficiency today.
Longer term, I think there is debottlenecking activity that will be available to us.
And in terms of the contracts on Gorgon and Wheatstone, we are about 90% committed under long term
contracts for those.

Hi, Sam.

Sam Margolin
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC

Q

Frank, I know you like to keep the call tight, but I would be remiss if I didn't say thanks and congrats as well. So
okay.
My first question is just sort of a mechanics question around the affiliates. I recall in the past some conversations
that there would be a co-lending program that would sort of functionally exclude affiliate spending from what we
might think about as operating cash flow. Is that still a factor? Or is there – has the Chevron level found kind of
more efficient uses of capital than that?


Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Yes. So the co-lending is really specific to the Tengiz project. And we had co-lending previously. Right now,
through 2018, we have had no requirement for any sort of co-lending.
With prices where they are today, and if they stay at this sort of level, it's not clear whether there will be a colending requirement in 2018. It's something you should always have in the back of your mind. But with prices at
this sort of level, maybe that is something that won't materialize for 2018.
The point of the co-lending – obviously this project was inaugurated back in a lower price environment. And the
point of the co-lending was to be able to assure and allow the fact of all partners being able to fund their share of
the project.
So it really has been dependent upon what prices have been and the ramp up of spend on the project per se.
2018 and 2019 will be the peak years of spending for TCO's investment project. But 2018 so far has certainly
been into a strong price environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Sam Margolin
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC

Q

I see, okay. Thanks for the clarification. And then my follow-up is just, I guess it's for both Mark and Pat. The
comments about thinking critically on Permian takeaway, I think resonate with the market, because it's come up
among a lot of the independents.
And given your sort of view on LNG markets globally, how do you see U.S. LNG maybe playing a role, particularly
with respect to kind of the areas in the Permian, more in the West Texas part of the Delaware Basin that are a
little gassier? If not as an operator, maybe as a partner or a customer of that solution?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark A. Nelson
Vice President-Midstream, Strategy & Policy, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, from a macro perspective, obviously you'll see companies start to – given some of the length that will occur
in the region, you'll start to see people consider further investments in the Gulf. And the Gulf Coast has to
compete with landed prices in Australia – or in Asia.
And from our perspective, we've got such an advantaged position, taking care of that Asian growth from our base
assets in Gorgon and Wheatstone, that we'll watch what others do. We certainly have other LNG options around
the world. But all of it has to compete with landed price in Asia.

Q

Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.

Hello. Thank you for taking my question. I'd like to go back to something you said earlier, Pat, which was about
the surge in production in the Permian over the quarter. You attribute it to more well completions.
And the follow-up that put in my mind was, can you say whether over the quarter you drew down your inventory of
DUCs? Or whether they were still building, just in terms of trying to assess the sustainability of that growth rate?
That's the first one. I've got a follow-up. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Okay. Thank you. The second one is about Indonesia, where I know you've got an early stage gas project in the
pipe. And one of your peers sanctioned a gas project there this week I think, so topical.
And I was wondering, so I think that that particular project you have, the holdup is really on the license
extensions. Is that right? If so what's the timing on resolving those? And if it's not right, can you say anything
about the other bottlenecks you still need to overcome there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

And we do have a new development concept – or we're reworking I guess a development concept, is the best
way to say it, trying to decapitalize. Work has been underway on that effort for the last several months, in fact
probably more than a year at this particular point in time. So work is progressing on that.
But I would also say that the contract extension is also an element here. And we've expressed and we've
delivered an expression of interest to the government of Indonesia with regard to extensions of the concession.
So we want to make sure that it's a long-lived project. And we want to make sure that the combination of the
development concept as well as the fiscal terms gives us a high return project.
