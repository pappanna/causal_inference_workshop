Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the
call with me today are Bruce Niemeyer, Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, and Frank Mount, General
Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the Cautionary Statement on slide two. I'll begin with a recap
of our third quarter 2016 financial and operational results and then Bruce will provide an update on our Permian
Basin business prior to my concluding remarks.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $1.3 billion
or $0.68 per diluted share. Third quarter results included $290 million in special items related to a deferred tax
benefit from the U.K. tax rate change and the receipt of an Ecuador arbitration award. Excluding these special
items as well as the positive impact from foreign exchange effects of $72 million, earni ngs for the quarter totaled
$921 million or $0.49 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the
Appendix to this presentation.
Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.3 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was 23.7%. Our net debt
ratio was approximately 20%. During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we
announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.08 per share payable to stockholders of record as of
November 18, 2016. Our annual per share payout for 2016 will be $4.29 per share and represents the 29th
consecutive year of growth in the annual per share payout. We currently yield 4.3%.
Turning to slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $5.3 billion during the third quarter and $9 billion year-todate. Year-to-date working capital effects of $1.3 billion and $3.1 billion in deferred tax items, for example those
associated with tax loss positions, reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are timing effects.
Proceeds from asset sales totaled $800 million in the third quarter, including the sale of selected Gulf of Mexico
assets. These transactions had a minimal impact on earnings in the quarter. Year-to-date asset sale proceeds are
$2.2 billion. We continue to pursue a number of potential transactions and we remain confident that we can
achieve our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next. Cash capital expenditures for
the quarter were $4.1 billion, a decrease of $2.7 billion from the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date cash
investment outlays have totaled approximately $14 billion.

During the quarter, we advanced $2 billion to Tengizchevroil, our TCO, in support of the FGP project. This outflow
is reflected in our cash flow statement as a borrowing by equity affiliates.
This first co-lending tranche provides sufficient funding as the project commences. Future advances are
expected, and the timing will be dependent upon oil prices, TCO's internal cash generation and the project's pace
of investment. At quarter end, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $7.7
billion and our net debt position was $37.9 billion.
Turning now to slide 5. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the s ame period last year. Third quarter
2016 results were $754 million lower than third quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the deferred tax
benefit related to the UK tax rate change, the award of an Ecuador arbitration claim and the absence of third
quarter 2015 asset impairments, increased earnings by $535 million between periods. Lower foreign exchange
gains decreased earnings by $322 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts
stem from balance sheet translations.
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were largely flat between quarters as lower
crude realizations were offset by lower operating expenses and favorable tax impacts. Downstream results,
excluding special items and FX, decreased by $1 billion primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins and
lower earnings from CPChem.
Turning now to slide 6. Here I'll compare results for the third quarter of 2016 with the second quarter of 2016.
Third quarter results were approximately $2.8 billion higher than the second quarter. The absence of second
quarter 2016 charges associated with special items and the inclusion of third quarter gains from special items
increased earnings by $2.7 billion between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by
approximately $200 million between periods.
Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were comparable between quarters, in line with
relatively flat Brent prices. Lower operational expenses were offset essentially by lower liftings and adverse tax
impacts. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were higher by $255 million,
primarily resulting from the absence of unfavorable second quarter inventory valuation effects. Prices were
generally rising during the second quarter, but relatively flat during the third quarter.
Turning to slide 7. Here we compare the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the
third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 26,000 barrels per day between
quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 77,000 barrels a day as ramp-ups continued at Gorgon,
Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG. About half of this bar is Gorgon.
Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and
Delaware Basins in the Permian, with all shale and tight basins reflecting year-on-year growth. More than half of
this bar is Permian production. Our base business declined with 66,000 barrels per day. Production from new
wells and other brownfield investments in the base added 39,000 barrels per day and helped hold the overall
base decline rate to less than 2%.
The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production
of 47,000 barrels per day. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut -in of 27,000
barrels per day, mainly due to security issues in Nigeria. Our planned turnaround activity was heavier than this
time last year, resulting in a decrease of 26,000 barrels per day, the most significant of which was at TCO as we
completed the turnaround of the second-generation plant. Based on nine months of actuals and our forecast for
the fourth quarter, we anticipate full-year 2016 production will be approximately 2.6 million barrels per day.
Turning now to slide 8. As we indicated on the second quarter call, we expect to exit the year with December
production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day, or growth in the range of 150,000 barrels per
day from the third quarter average. A major contributor, as previously discussed, is TCO's return to production on
September 9, following the largest planned turnaround in its history ahead of schedule, under budget and without
serious incidents or injuries.
Over the course of six weeks, maintenance was conducted on more than 500 pieces of equipment. At its peak,
over 8,800 employees and contractors were on site for the turnaround. The team worked proactively with over 30
contract companies on all stages of planning, preparation and execution. This was a large undertaking that was
exceptionally well-executed.
The second contributor to volume growth in December is the ramp-up of our LNG projects, notably Gorgon. At
Gorgon, Train 1 production is stable and Train 2 is now online. At Angola LNG, the plant reached a rate of
approximately 5 million tons per year of LNG. Production has been suspended while minor modifications to reac h
full capacity are completed. Short-duration shutdowns are often experienced as facilities are ramped up to their
full capacity.
ALNG expects to restart the plant within the next couple of weeks and will continue to ramp up and fine -tune the
system. Since the initial restart earlier this year, they have shipped eight LNG cargoes and 16 LPG cargoes. In
addition to LNG volume increases, we achieved first production from Bangka in August and expect first production
from Alder before year-end. We also expect continued growth in our unconventionals and from our base business
investments.
Turning now to slide 9. At Gorgon, total Train 1 LNG production has been stable, at an average rate of 110,000
barrels per day, which is about 5 million tons per year. We are also producing about 6,700 barrels per day of
condensate. As mentioned, Train 2 is running and producing LNG. Production is expected to ramp up over the
coming months. We have shipped 17 cargoes to date, and with both trains now running, we expect to ship an
average of two to three cargoes per week. Construction on Train 3 is progressing very well, and we expect first
LNG in the second quarter of 2017.
At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. We are leveraging our experience from
Gorgon and are pleased with our progress. All modules for Train 1 and Train 2 are now on-site, and the
installation of piping, electrical and instrumentation continue as planned. As we have foreshadowed, the delay in
module delivery at Wheatstone has impacted project costs relative to the original 2011 estimate. We now forecast
the total project cost at completion to be $34 billion U.S. dollars. Chevron's share of the cost to complete the
project is included in the $17 billion to $22 billion capital guidance range that we have previously communicated
for the 2017 to 2018 years.
Bruce will now provide an update on our activities in the Permian. Bruce?

Bruce Niemeyer

Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide 10. As we have shared previously, Chevron enjoys a very strong acreage position in
the Permian Basin. Our acreage is extensive, covering about 2 million acres. We have major holdings in the best
basin locations and enjoy a significant royalty advantage over our competitors. Our strategy in the Permian is
centered on building a large-scale asset that delivers strong returns and generates free cash flow.
To accomplish this, we have implemented a well factory modeled after the most efficient short-cycle operations in
Chevron and in industry. The goal of this factory is to create repeatable high-value outcomes at sufficient scale
that are material for Chevron. Decisions around many key design elements are consistently implemented, not
only the obvious ones such as horizontal lateral length, well spacing and completion parameters, but also
hundreds of other decisions that we face on a routine basis for which we want consistent outcomes.
As we identify and verify improvements, they are quickly implemented into our basis of design. Our pace has
been intentionally deliberate to allow us to incorporate the learnings and experience from our own work and that
of the industry. The result is a high degree of confidence that we will achieve the outcomes we expect. Our results
are competitive and continue to improve.
Turning to slide 11, you can see Chevron's acreage position in more detail. This slide is a map of the Permian
Basin, inclusive of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Our 2 million acres are depicted in blue, 1.5 million of
which are in the Midland and Delaware basins. Also depicted on the map are active Chevron-operated
developments in blue and our non-operated development areas in purple. We believe the quality of our acreage
position is exceptional, with multiple stacked geologic targets.
Today, we estimate that almost 600,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 per acre. We have an
additional 350,000 acres with a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre. The balance of our acreage is
a mix. Some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation, some lacks nearby infrastructure and some
requires further appraisal. These estimates are a snapshot that assumes a simultaneous development, a flat $50
WTI price and are burdened with all development and production costs as we see them today.
We're active in several company-operated and non-operated joint venture development areas. We're currently
running eight drilling rigs on our operated acreage. We're standing up our ninth rig as we speak, and expect to be
at 10 by the end of the year. Another 10 rigs are currently drilling on our non-operated development areas. We
prioritize development areas by value, which considers expected ultimate recovery, cost of development, oil/gas
split, availability of surface infrastructure and our overall certainty of outcome.
Turning to slide 12. To achieve strong returns, we focus on all elements necessary to generate cash flow: capital
efficiency, operating expense and product realizations. The graph in the upper-right corner shows development
cost per barrel, which in our view is the ultimate measure of capital performance, as it incorporates all sub metrics. We have achieved a 30% development cost reduction from 2015, fully inclusive of drilling, completions,
facilities and associated G&A.
We've accomplished this through a focus on improving expected ultimate recovery, driving execution efficiencies
and implementing supply chain savings. This is delivering capital performanc e that is competitive with the
operators of our joint ventures. The trend of improvement is mirrored in our overall unit operating expense. The
lower-right graph reflects both the downward trend and competitive performance of our direct lease operating
expense and illustrates a significant reduction of 45% from 2015.
Our lease operating expense includes all costs required to operate a well and its associated facilities during its
life. We expect these wells to produce for decades, so attention to operating efficiency unlocks value. Additionally,
G&A, which is not included in the graph on the lower right, is a component of overall operating expense. Our year to-date G&A is $3.50 a barrel, declining through the year and more than 20% from 2015.

The third critical aspect of cash flow is product realizations. We've leveraged the scale of our core positions to
systematically secure cost-effective priority access through the entire crude and gas value chain rather than
simply selling production at the wellhead. Because of this, we have options available to respond to changing
market and industry conditions.
Turning to slide 13. We expect activity and production from the Permian to grow through the end of the decade.
As we discussed in our Analyst Day last March, by the end of 2020, Chevron's Permian shale and tight production
is expected to reach 250,000 barrels to 350,000 barrels per day. As you can see on the chart, we have initiated
this growth. Production continues to track ahead of expectations and is 24% higher than third quarter 2015. We
continually monitor our performance and have the option to adjust the pace of our growth as needed to optimize
value from this asset.
While growing production is important, we're focused on expanding margins by increasing efficiencies in our
operations and on capturing maximum value from the resource space. We believe we're well -positioned to make
the Permian a legacy asset with strong returns and free cash flow.
Now I'll hand it back to Pat to discuss spend reductions. Pat?

Patricia E. Yarrington

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Now on slide 14, we continue to reduce our spend. You can see on the chart the huge
progress that we've made and continue to make in curtailing our outflows. We expect 2016 combined operating
expense and capital expenditure outflows to be down more than $12 billion or more than 20% from 2015.
We expect to meet, if not exceed, the commitment we made earlier in the year to have 2016 operating expens es
come in $2 billion lower than 2015. And our C&E is trending below the guidance range previously provided for this
year. We will likely end the year below $25 billion in capital outlays, in fact, potentially come in closer to $24
billion. This is a tremendous amount of progress in a relatively short 24-month period of time to reset these key
financial parameters consistent with a lower-for-longer price environment.
Turning to slide 15, I'd like to close with just a couple of points. First, our financial priorities have not changed.
Sustaining and growing the dividend is our first priority. The increase this quarter demonstrates that commitment,
which is underpinned by a confidence in our future earnings and cash flow growth.
Second, we are beginning to see evidence of that cash flow growth, notably now that Gorgon Train 1 is operating
well and Train 2 is successfully online, and with Gorgon's Train 3, and Wheatstone's Trains 1 and 2 plan to come
on in fairly rapid succession over the next five quarters. We have approximately 85% of the production from these
five trains sold under long-term contracts. And at today's contractual LNG prices, this represents a significant
revenue and cash margin boost.
Third, we have successfully transitioned to a lower price environment. Of course, we are not resting on these
recent accomplishments. We will continue to look for opportunities to improve cost and capital efficiency. We are
poised to be a very resilient competitor in a low-price world. Our Permian asset base speaks directly to this. Here,
we have an abundance of riches in terms of the physical asset base, and we are successfully demonstrating the
ability to develop this resource in a highly capital efficient returns -focused manner.

With costs coming down, with C&E and capital intensity coming down, with our major LNG projects and the
Permian production coming online to boost cash margins and production, our overall financial picture is set to
improve in a meaningful way as we move into 2017. Our objective is to get cash balanced in 2017, assuming $50
Brent prices. All of these improvements I've just noted, as well as targeted asset sales where we can transact for
value, are key components supporting that objective.
So this concludes our prepared remarks and we're now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that
we do have a full queue and try to limit yourself to one question or perhaps one follow-up, if necessary. We will do
our best to get all of your questions answered.
Jonathan, could you open the lines, please?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel
from Jefferies. Your question, please?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gammel

Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Thanks very much, everyone, and thanks especially for the incremental disclosure on the Permian. I'd like to
direct my question there. Bruce, you mentioned that the finding and development costs was probably one of the
most important metrics that you have in the Basin. Can you talk about how you're benchmarking yourself against
some of the E&P companies in the Basin, and how you think that might improve as you get your infrastructure into
place?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer

Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks for the question, Jason. On slide 12, we showed finding and development costs per barrel. The lighter
bars are the Chevron-operated activity. And the darker bars are those of our NOJV competitors where we also
invest. That is our best direct benchmarking comparison because we invest in the wells and we're able to see the
full value chain that is created. We're able to address the issues directly of financial performance that aren't often
available from a less complete data set.
I suppose there's a narrative that a company of our size can't be competitive. But in the case of Chevron, we are.
The NOJV partners that are listed on this chart are some of the best in the Basin. And you can see on the chart
that our performance today is competitive and improving.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gammel
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

That's great. Just as a follow-up, can you maybe address the pace of development that you think you could
achieve? I recognize that you've got your projection of volumes through 2020. But for such a huge acreage
position, what type of rig program do you think you could ultimately apply in the Basin? And then I suppose the
other question there would be, just given the position you have, would you maybe consider monetizing some of
the position through acreage sales or through joint ventures?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer

A

Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

Let me start with pace first. We are already growing. As I noted, we've initiated the growth. In fact, we've added
five rigs over essentially the second half of 2016. That's a pace of rig additions of about one rig a month.
Production's grown from the third quarter of last year by 24%, further supporting the notion that we're growing.
And our pace and rate of additions are intentional.
Again, we're focused on returns. I don't feel capital limited in the Permian Basin. And our additions are targeted to
ensure that we're getting the outcomes we intend and that are supportive of high returns and eventually
generating free cash flow. We do expect to grow, as you noted. You can see that on slide 13. And as we go
forward, we have options. We continually monitor our performance and we adjust.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, and, Jason, let me just add a thought to that. As you know, we have had a practice when we have had
pieces of our portfolio where we felt there wasn't longer-term strategic value or felt others would offer more value
for us than it would obtain in our portfolio, we've been willing to make asset sales. And we've had a very routine
practice of having asset sales over a long number of years here.
I think the key to getting to that point in the decision process, though, is having a really good understand ing of the
value of the asset. And in the Permian Basin, there's been a great deal of fluidity in that valuation over the last
couple of years. There's been a great deal of additional appraisal and evaluation work and there's been a great
deal of greater understanding, but there still has been significant movement. In some cases, pieces of property
have moved up by a factor of 10,000 fold. And that's the kind of thing that you would not want to get on the wrong
side of in your haste to make a decision about selling an asset.
So our process will be to try to do evaluation and appraisal work, get a really good understanding of what this
asset valuation is. And to the extent that we don't find it fitting into our longer-term development plan, then, of
course, we look to other monetization options.

question, please?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey

Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

Good morning, everyone. Thanks. A follow-up for Bruce on the Permian. How much are you guys spending there
annually? Could you give an idea of the level of CapEx and the outlook for CapEx?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Yes, Paul. We're spending presently in the area of about $1.5 billion annually across both the company -operated
and our non-operated joint venture programs.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

So the outlook for that is flat, is it, or is that going to go up?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer

Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

A

I would expect it to go up. At our current pace, we're delivering a growth profile. You can see on slide 13 what we
shared at the Analyst Day last March in terms of production growth. And there would be some growing activity
that would support that. We are continually getting more efficient. And so the c apital invested that we expect
going forward will be more efficient, as reflected by the finding and development cost trend that we showed on
slide 12.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey

Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

Understood. So if I look at the Tengiz Expansion, you're spending – previously in September you'd said $18 per
BOE of development cost for I think a $36 billion investment. Why would you be spending so much less in the
Permian at what I think looks like a $10 F&D costs per barrel? Maybe that one's for Pat.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, it is. So, Paul, just a couple of things. I mean, if you go back to slide 13 here, I think we have said that –
and we said this back [indiscernible] (28:27) and throughout the year here, that we could see the top end of that
light blue portion of the profile there would result in approximately a doubling of our current activity levels. And so
we're spending $1.5 billion here. You can see us potentially doubling that. And that is kind of the current view that
we have. But, again, this is an area that we'll update you when we get to the March Security Analyst Meeting.
In reference to FGP, the Future Growth Project in Tengiz, I think it's important to know that we are funding both of
these projects, both the Permian fully and FGP. We think of these projects, these areas, as being absolutely
critical growth areas for us so we're not starving the Permian because we've taken on FGP.
I think what people often miss around FGP is that there would be a tremendous loss of value if we didn't go
forward with the wellhead pressure management project because the field would go into decline. It would be in
serious decline. And that would be loss of value in a legacy asset. We're doing FGP and WPMP together because
of synergies. It's a joint development concept and there's a lot of upside that has not been built into a lot of
people's models I guess I would say about FGP that relate to debottlenecking. What we've been able to
demonstrate in the past we hope to be able to do on a go-forward basis.
There's additional gas handling facilities built in here that will over time allow greater oil production.
Contingencies, we've talked through about being kind of fully contingent even though we're at 50% of engineering
when we took FID. And then, of course, down the road, obviously we hope that this turns into concession
extension. So there's a lot of potential upsides to FGP. I think Jay did a great job on our second quarter call in
running through all of those parameters.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey

Q

Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

So what you're saying is that the $18 per barrel development costs there is a very conservative number and it
would be competitive with the Permian ultimately when all those things are c onsidered?

Q

Two questions, if I could. Bruce, one is the recovery way that you use to get to that 9 billion barrels. Are you using
10%, 12%? And then what do you expect and foresee that that recovery rate may change over the next say five
years?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer
Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, so the 9 billion barrels is from a portion of our acreage that is currently highly characterized. It varies by
horizon and by area in the Basin, be it Midland or Delaware Basin. Recoveries are generally single-digit. And we
know that in a basin or in a play at this state of maturity, there is a lot of upside potential. We have a technology
organization that's working hard every day to take the first stage of development and improve upon it, much as we
have in other asset classes that we operate in and are more mature.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Cheng

Would you be willing to give a forecast of what that recovery rate may look like in five years?

No, not at this point.

Paul Cheng

Q

Okay. Pat, the second question at Wheatstone, you're talking about the cost increase. Given the lower Australian
dollar and supposedly weaker labor market, which is translating into better product ivities, can you elaborate a little
bit more on what's causing the cost increase?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. Sure, Paul. Yeah, as I said, we're now expecting a $34 billion total project cost, so that's up about $5 billion
from the original AR. That original appropriation request was taken in 2011. And as you can all appreciate, the
first few years of construction there was in a much more heated market.
But we've talked in the past about our late module delivery, and this really was one of the primary drivers behind
the cost increase. They were delayed due to poor performance at one of the fabricating yards. It came to be that
the contractor was unable to effectively manage the size and the scale of the work scope that we had given that
particular contractor. So we recognized that somewhat early on and we did end up redirecting some of the work to
other yards. But, even so, the modules were late.
A second factor that I would comment on is really an underestimation of the quantity of materials that were
required. At the time we took FID on Wheatstone, we had engineering, was it about 15% complete, and so the
rest was based on rules of thumb and factors. As we matured the engineering definition, the amount of quantities
needed increased substantially. And so that really was a secondary reason behind the cost increase.
I would say the second element was something that we had seen on Gorgon as well and it is one of the primary
areas where we are trying to improve our project execution going forward. As you know, we had FGP, when we
took FID on FGP, we were at about nearly at 50% engineering level. So this is one of the primary improvement
practices that we're putting in place for future projects.

Philip M. Gresh

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Bruce, you made a comment in one of the earlier questions about a free cash flow focus. And I'm just wondering if
you take together what you said about capital spending in the production outlook, when would you expect the
Permian to become free cash flow positive? And how do you think about some of the assets in the Permian that
might need some more material infrastructure spending? Is that something that you guys are willing to spend a lot
of money on in the next few years? Or are you most focused on kind of more immediate cash flow?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer

A

Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

Thanks for the question, Phil. We'll provide more color and specifics in the Analysts Day next March. We do have
internal projections on when the overall program reaches free cash flow. And that obviously depends on a number
of factors, including the trajectory that we pursue. And I'll remind you again, we have many options to adjust
based on the results that we see. We do have an integrated approach where we not only connect the upstream
activity that we're engaged in drilling and completing wells, but pair that with midstream activity to move product to
the market centers that we choose.
We typically engage in that through commercial transactions. It's a very competitive basin. There's a lot of
companies that operate in that space. We typically deploy our capital in the areas where we can differentiate our
performance in drilling and completions and then working with high-quality third-party suppliers, look to them to
move the crude to market, operate the gas processing and NGL fractionation activities.

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Okay. Got it. Thanks. And my follow-up – I guess maybe this would be best for Pat, kind of following on what Paul
was asking about $10 F&D in the Permian, $18 for Tengiz. Where would you say, as you're assessing the
deepwater opportunities in the portfolio, particularly the brownfield side of things, how would that stack up at this
stage as costs continue to come down?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

Brownfield would be very good. Greenfield would be a little bit more challenge, but brownfield would be very
good.

Doug Leggate

Q

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Pat and Bruce and Frank, I'm not sure who wants to take this one. But
Chevron's always been a company led by large-scale major project developments, exploration, and so on. And I
guess what I'm really trying to understand here is, what are the limiting factors on the Permian, given its flexibility,
lower execution risk, the absence of the kind of cost issues you've had in things like Gorgon and Wheatstone? I
guess what I'm asking is, is the Permian big enough to drive a much more meaningful strategic shift in how
Chevron allocates capital longer term? Is that what we're looking at here?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

I think best if I take that one here, Doug. I think when you have such a extraordinary asset base in the Permian,
when it has as much depth and breadth to it, and I don't mean that in a literal sense but a figurative sense, such
huge economic strength, everything in the portfolio really needs to be judged against those options.
And so when I think about – we don't believe we want to be just a single asset class company. So we have great
strategic capabilities and basin positions in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater, we have the Tengiz project that we
talked about, we have the LNG projects. So we have a pretty broad-based portfolio here, and we're not looking to
take all activity down to the Permian.
But the value of the Permian and its tremendous economic capability and its capital efficiency, its great flexibility,
its short-cycle, high-return attributes, does make other parts of the portfolio have to compete for capital against
that. So I think it raises the bar on where that incremental dollar is going to go. And I think Permian will get the
first call, but we will manage it as a portfolio. And over time you should still expect us to have some significant
other projects, but we can pace those projects quite nicely I think and match against – always coming back to and
matching against the opportunities that the Permian provides for us.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate

Q

So put simply, Pat, the Permian is going to take market share from the rest of your portfolio? Is that a good way of

Q

I guess a related question, my follow-up, is that there's been – we haven't talked much about disposals I guess in
a couple quarters. I'm guessing a high-grading exercise, if you want to call it that, like the Permian, changes the
map a little bit in terms of what competes for capital. There's been some speculation around Bangladesh, which is
sizable, obviously. I think you've talked about that publicly. Can you just give us an update as to where you see
the changing map on the disposal, both in scale and perhaps any identified assets that have changed since the
Analyst Day?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, we really haven't changed our view. I mean, we look at asset sales when we can get good value, that's first
and foremost, not strategic or we don't see kind of the compelling relationship within the Chevron portfolio. We've
announced certain assets for sale. And we put a list out in the second quarter there. The list essentially is the
same. I can confirm that there are commercial discussions going on in and around Bangladesh. But I'll go back to
the primary element here, which is we want to get good value. And so on any of these transactions that we've sort
of queued up and are beginning to have people into data rooms, either in an early round or a secondary round, if
in fact we don't get the value proposition that we're seeking, then we'll just move on.

please?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Edward George Westlake

Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Q

Yes, good morning. So that slide 12 is great and shows how you've made improvement. I mean, I guess you're
still a little bit above the development costs of the non-operated JV partners. Maybe is that geographical? Is there
some different ways that you approach the business? So just maybe some color on that.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer

Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure, Ed. Yeah, and we're providing you on this chart quarterly data. And it's an aggregation of everything that
was completed in that particular quarter. And you're right to suspect that there's a little portfolio aspect to what
goes on in any particular quarter. We have operations in both the Midland and Delaware Basin on the company operated side and on the NOJV side as well. And the mix of activity in any particular quarter's going to cause
those bars to be up and down a little bit.
If we had the fourth quarter of 2015, you'd see two quarters where the company -operated bars are a little lower,
and the last two quarters where the NOJV bars are a little lower. But we look internally in a much finer level of
detail. Wolfcamp B wells in the Central Midland Basin, mile and a half laterals and are we comparable in that
activity or not and what do we address about that. So the overall performance is competitive.
And I will tell you that there is a competitive group. There's a lead pack in the Permian. And we're a part of that. I
think the data on slide 12 shows that. And some of the quarter-to-quarter variations are simply a function of which
particular wells are completing. And because our costs include full-cycle, there are facility costs in our bars in the
quarter in which we start wells in a new area and have central tank batteries or other things that are being
executed in that period.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

It's just a great portfolio with also tax and royalty advantages. And you'll want to get after it, the rest of the industry
is getting after it. Maybe just give us some high-level thoughts about inflation. On the one hand, there's probably
still learnings that can improve that development cost as you progress. On the other hand, things might get a little
hard over the next few years. So maybe just some high-level thoughts as to how you think about that.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer

A

Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, we've certainly driven in the last two years to a very positive position. We operate in a dynamic price
environment and a dynamic activity environment. Over the last two years, we've really leveraged the scale of
Chevron where we have an advantage to do so. So tubulars, or the pipe that goes in the wells, is a key cost
component. And Chevron buys a lot of pipe around the world. So we're able to leverage our worldwide supply
chain effort to bring advantage to pricing to what we do.
We also consolidate work with key suppliers, have consolidated work to give us the right combination of unit price,
execution performance, access to technology and the ability to grow with us. And then we've put in place some
contractual arrangements with unit-based fixed terms. Some are index-based, some of these are performance
incentives, but they're all intended to keep us on the competitive side of the price curve irrespective of what
commodity prices are doing.
Structurally, the things that stay with us in any price environment are multi-well pad designs, which we've done for
a very long time, the acreage position that we have that allow us to drill longer lat eral lengths, efficiencies that we
engage in on a daily basis in terms of something we call zipper fracking, where you have activities occurring
simultaneously. And those will stay with us regardless of what price does.

please?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta

Q

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.

Good morning, everyone. Pat, really good progress here on capital spending. Where do you believe we're
tracking relative to guidance here in 2016 for CapEx? And then relative to the $17 billion to $22 billion, any early
look of how the deflation you've seen in 2016 will carry forward?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, so I think we had said before that 2016 we thought would come in at $25 billion, around $25 billion. I think
last time I said even below $25 billion. And this time, I'm really thinking we'll probably be closer to $24 billion. So a
significant reduction from a year ago's time.
We're in the process of doing our business plan right now. The range that we put out for 2017 to 2018 is in the
$17 billion to $22 billion range. I think we will be in that range. We're just going through and doing the prioritization
at the moment. And we'll come out typically with a C&E press release after our board approves the plan, and I
don't really want to get ahead of that.
But obviously, all of the efficiencies, the cost efficiencies that we've seen – Bruce just talked through some of
those in his business unit, but those are going on around the globe in t erms of supplier optimization, supplier
rationalization and getting our supply chain costs down. That will continue. And I think we'll hold onto that.
The one area where there probably is a little bit of an inflationary element will be the Permian because that's
where investment is being attracted. But when you look around the rest of the world, that is really not happening
in the rest of the world. Investment is not going to those locations, so we're not seeing those kind of cost
pressures. So we believe the efficiencies through the supply chain organization that we've been able to capture
will hold there.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.

Q

That's a good follow-up. And maybe this is for Bruce here, but as you see activity pick up in the Permian, do you
see any bottlenecks, either from an infrastructure perspective, labor perspective or other parts of the resource that
will make it difficult for you to achieve the high-end of the range that we talked about?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer

Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

A

We certainly recognize, Neil, that we have to plan ahead. And we do so. When you think about takeaway, our
efforts in maximizing realization have a secondary component, which is flow assurance, to make sure that we're
able to move to the market centers, the locations where we ultimately wish to sell, without being disrupted.
When you get to the supply of drilling and completing wells, the suppliers that we work with we pick intentionally,
in part for their ability to grow, both in terms of the availability of the equipment, the type of equipment we want
and their staffing plans in terms of how they will staff and maintain that staffing going forward. So there will be
some changes overall in the Basin, but we're taking a multi-year view and able to look a little bit into the future
and base our planning around that.

................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Blake Fernandez

Analyst, Scotia Howard Weil

Q

Folks, good morning. Pat, going back to deflationary pressures you're seeing on CapEx. I think you allud ed to $50
Brent breakeven which is pretty consistent with what you articulated before. Is it fair to think that that number is
trending lower also?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

We are working very hard to get that number lower. Absolutely. And it certainly has moved down from when we
first put that target out there, yes, meaning our actuals are moving in that direction. So, yes, we are trying as best
we can through operating efficiencies, capital efficiencies, to have our outflows contained relative to the inflows
that we anticipate coming out there. So it's what I consider to be a cost structure reset and a capital expenditure
reset given the environment that we're in.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Blake Fernandez
Analyst, Scotia Howard Weil

Q

Okay. Fair enough. And then, Bruce, on the Permian, it looks like you're trending above the top end of guidance
or your range. Obviously, you're adding rigs. We probably haven't seen the full impact of that yet. Is there any
reason to believe that you're not on track to potentially surpass what the upper end of this range is here?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer

Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, we're ahead now, and our guidance remains the same at this point to 2020: 250,000 to 350,000 barrels a
day. Our Analyst Day in March is the typical time where we would unpack more of that for you and everybody
else.

Q

Hey. Good afternoon, and good results today. My first question, staying with the Permian, Bruce. I know some of
your acreage in South Reeves, West Reeves overlaps Apache's recently announced Alpine High play. Can you
share your view on the viability of that play, potential economics, and how t hat would or may compete for capital
with this Permian core that you've laid out today?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer

Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure, Evan. Well, let me start first by saying we're excited by this activity and hope it 's fully successful. We have
180,000 acres in our portfolio, and you can see it there on the slide. But it's a great example of how our strategy
has played out across the Permian, allowing the industry to de-risk and create data that can refine our
assessment. Alpine High, that area in the southern part of Reeves County, is right now on our overall portfolio pie
in that wedge that is labeled less than $20,000 per acre.
The subsurface is structurally more complex. It appears to be a little more gassy, and i t's far from existing
infrastructure. But additional positive data certainly has the potential to move that area to higher value. And if it
does, we go through a regular re-sort of priorities and we would adjust our activity as that indicated.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Great. And maybe my second is, it's a follow-up to some prior Permian questions. But just to understand, does
the upside to your Permian production range, which is the same as it was in May despite the improvements her e,
does that represent the limit to how much you can grow in a capital-efficient manner and whether that looks
achievable on a 30-rig program by the end of 2020? And, if so, what are the limiting factors in your current plan to
how much the Permian can take and subsequently grow?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer
Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, our focus in the near term and, quite frankly, throughout, is on capital efficiency. And we are focused not on
chasing a particular production curve. Growing production is important. Growing volume is important. But
retaining efficiency throughout what we do. We have many options going forward to adjust our pace of activity up
and down. We have the ability to grow activity. But it is returns that we are ultimately focused on, and that will
drive our decision making going forward.

Q

Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Ltd.

Friends, good morning or good afternoon, wherever you're sitting in the world. I want to ask a question away from
the Permian, if I can. If I could just get an update on Rosebank in the UK North Sea just in terms of – I know you
were out rebidding and negotiating, just how you're seeing that project stack up in terms of its costs? If you can
give any update, and if I can have a follow-up, please.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Well, I think all I can say at this point, I mean, we are in essence staying with that project in FEED while we're
trying to get the development costs down. So I don't have a lot of specific information to provide for you. But
obviously, with what's happened to oil price, what's happened to the optionality that we have here in the Permian,
there is a competing-for-capital element that Rosebank has to fight for within our portfolio.
So we're continuing to work at it. We recognize how important Rosebank is to the region. We recognize how
important it is to the UK. But we have in the past been able to take a second look at the design and get costs
down. In the past, we've been able to re-characterize the subsurface and work improvements in there. And we're
just still on that same process.

Q

Hi. My first question was on some of your other potential international project sanctions. Wanted to get a little bit
of an update on the Gulf of Mexico projects, where you're at in terms of the appraisals and potential
developments. So the ones I was thinking of were the Anchor project, the Tigris project and Sicily.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. So on Anchor, we're still in the appraisal process. Feel positive about it, but we're still in the appraisal
process there. On Tigris, there's multiple fields that are involved here. The appraisal drilling has been completed,
and we have filed for a suspension of production here. On Sicily, we've allowed the leases to lapse.

Anish Kapadia

Q

Okay. Thank you. And then I had a question for Bruce on the Permian. And, again, thank you for the useful slides
that you put out. In terms of the high-graded area that you've talked about, the 600,000 acres, within that, I was
wondering if you could give some idea of the number of locations that are contained within that in your current
thinking and which benches you're looking – you're currently thinking are going to be developed in that acreage.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer

Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, the areas that are at the top of our queue vary between the Midland and Delaware Basin as do the horizons.
The things that we're most interested in are, again, those that create the right kind of full-cycle returns. And so the
oil and gas split between those areas, the cost of execution of those areas are what causes it to be in the top tier
for us.
So in the Midland Basin, Wolfcamp B and Lower Spraberry are two horizons that we like a lot. We also like some
aspects of the Wolfcamp in the Delaware Basin. We're drilling wells in a few other horizons. But there isn't a one size-fits-all. You'll move to one part of the Basin, and that particular horizon that you're interested in is just not as
great a value as others. So what we do in these development areas is put together a strategy that paces
development based on value. We go to the best-performing horizon on a return basis first and then follow it with
the others. And there's not a simple answer that fits the whole Basin.

please?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Hey. Thanks. Great result. Maybe I'll stick on the trend and ask one Permian question followed by another one.
But in the Permian, if you look at your acreage, if you look on the map on 11 and you've shown this map a
number of different times. But you've still got a lot of checkerboard acreage across core portions of t he Permian
Basin. Any further interest at this point in potential JVs or partnerships, like you did with Cimarex in the past, that
would allow for an increasing amount of long laterals and capital-efficient developments? Or how do you think
about managing that acreage going forward?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Niemeyer

A

Vice President, Mid-Continent Business Unit, Chevron Corp.

It's a good question. We are actually very actively engaged in swaps, working with the individuals that would own
or have rights to a checkerboarded acreage. And we've actually executed quite a number of those. It does allow
us to extend laterals, concentrate facilities and infrastructure in certain places.
We will also contemplate joint ventures where that leads us to the right kind of return outcomes if a combination of
acreage in some way leads to a more efficient result. But I will tell you that what's been more active for us in the
last year and a half has been finding acreage consolidations that we could make through swaps. And that's
bolstered by the fact that our company-operated execution is becoming highly efficient. And those are the sorts of
activities that are driving returns to the top of our Q.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan Todd
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

Great. Thanks. And then maybe if I could ask one maybe a question for Pat there, kind of a high-level
philosophical one. If we look at what the majors, such as yourself, have been able to do in terms of capital
reduction over the past couple years, it's been quite impressive. And as we look forward over the next, let's say,
two to five years, and I realize that there's a ton of variables in this, how do you think about what a reasonable
level of sustainable CapEx is? If you talk about potentially being sub $20 billion a year in 2017, has there be en
enough structural cost deflation or efficiency gains that that is a reasonable medium -term level to think about
longer term? Or does that still feel like capital starvation mode and there's a need to bounce back into some level
in the 20 billions that's more sustainable for the medium-term?
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, so I think the critical variable that you're leaving unsaid there is what's happening to price. Just a little bit on
price. I think our own view here is that in the medium-term here we're potentially going to be range-bound. We are
constructive on price. And we do think over time here there will be price appreciation, but we see it being
relatively modest. But in the period that we're talking about here, I don't see that changing our view of the $17
billion to $22 billion range being appropriate for us.
You're hearing a lot about the Permian being one of the best investment opportunities that we have. And the great
thing about that is that it's short cycle, it's high return, it's very flexible. And so that gives us – it lowers our capital
intensity, gives us greater flexibility than we have had in several years.
And then the only other major project that we sanctioned at this point in time is TCO, and our share of that in
terms of outflow would be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion a year over the next few years. So we consider
that to be very manageable and that's within the $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you. So I think
that's a reasonable range on C&E to expect for us under a reasonable range of prices that might be anticipated.
Okay. I think we have time...

Sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off there. I think we've got time for one more question.

Operator: Thank you. Our final question then comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.
Your question, please?

Thank you, guys. Just a quick one about Nigeria. You mentioned losing $28,000 a day in Q3. What kind of
recovery have you seen on your Nigerian assets so far this quarter? And what is embedded in the exit rate
guidance that you gave for the year?

Well, I think we have two factors going on. We have had some instances of sabotage, as we've talked about. We
had a more recent one here in the last couple of days. So that's obviously a detriment that is impacting Nigerian
production. But on the opposite side, we've got Agbami plateau extension investments coming online. So I think
that it's not a huge factor in terms of a variance in what we're showing for the December exit range.

All right. So I think that concludes our call for the third quarter here. I'd like to thank everybody for your time on the
call. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron and we appreciate everybody's participation on the call.
Thank you very much.
