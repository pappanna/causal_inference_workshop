Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean, and I will be your conference facility facilitator today. Welcome to
Chevron's fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session, and instructions will be given at that
time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr.
John Watson. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Well, thanks, Sean. And welcome to everyone to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast.
On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington – you all know our Chief Financial Officer – and Jeanette Ourada,
our General Manager of Investor Relations. And we'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, as usual, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and
other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.

Turn to Slide 3. I want to begin with safety, where we always do. In March of last year, I talked with you at some
length about Chevron's safety journey, over 100 years of focus and improvements in our systems and processes. I
said we work to improve every day. As a result of our efforts, every key measure of safety and environmental
performance has improved dramatically over the last decade. In fact, we just had another very good statistical year
in safety. We had world-class low industrial injury rates. We had fewer fires, serious auto, and other incidents –
some very good performance during the year. But we're nowhere near where we want to be.
In particular, we had drilling-related incidents in recent months in Brazil and Nigeria, sadly with two contract
employee fatalities in Nigeria. We have full investigations under way and are doing everything we can to learn
from these incidents. There is a great deal of information available on our website, and I'll be happy to answer any
questions after we complete our prepared remarks.
Our financial performance in 2011 was outstanding. We achieved record earnings and cash flow, underscoring the
strength of our portfolio and strategic direction. Underlying these record financial results is our outstanding
upstream earnings per barrel. We invest to generate value for our shareholders, and we like high-value barrels.
While our peers have not all reported their fourth quarter results, we fully expect to maintain our wide lead on this
critical metric.
I'd like to summarize a few additional accomplishments. In the Upstream business, we sanctioned three major
projects. We broke ground in December on Wheatstone, our second legacy LNG project in Australia. We also
moved forward on Clair Ridge in the UK and Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf of Thailand, our
Platong II project started up and ramped up very quickly. We completed our acquisition of Atlas Energy and
supplemented it with some additional acreage acquisitions in the Marcellus. We continued our string of
exploration successes offshore Australia with four natural gas discoveries. And we announced the Moccasin oil
discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And we achieved a 171% reserve replacement, driven by the initial
booking of about 740 million barrels of oil equivalent from our Wheatstone LNG project.
Looking at our Downstream business, we made great progress in the second year of a three-year plan to improve
returns. The completion of the Pembroke refinery sale marked a significant milestone in our portfolio
rationalization process. We also made a final investment decision and began construction on a premium base oil
plant at our Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery, which when completed will position Chevron as the world's leading
supplier of premium base oils.
We're very proud of our performance this past year. With that, I'll turn it over to Pat, who will take you through
our financial results. Pat?

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

All right, thanks, John.
Slide 4 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter earnings were $5.1
billion, or $2.58 per diluted share. For the year, earnings were a record $27 billion, or $13.44 per diluted share,
over 40% higher than in 2010. Return on capital employed for the year was nearly 22%. And our debt ratio at
year-end was 7.7%.
Of particular note, 2011 marked our 24th consecutive annual dividend increase. We had two dividend increases
during the year, which resulted in a combined 12.5% rise in the quarterly rate in 2011. This is significant,
indicating not only our superior performance and our financial strength, but also our confidence in our future
performance. It is also consistent with our priority of rewarding shareholders with sustained and competitive
dividend growth.
In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares, bringing the full-year share repurchase total to
$4.25 billion. In the first quarter of 2012, we expect to repurchase $1.25 billion of our shares. Finally, Chevron's
2011 total shareholder return was 20%. We hold the number one TSR position versus our peer group for the one-,
five-, and 10-year periods. We are exceptionally proud of this achievement, as it demonstrates our history of
making wise portfolio investment decisions and executing well.
Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $8.3 billion during the quarter. For the full year, cash
from operations exceeded $40 billion, a record for the company, and over 28% higher than last year. This reflects
our impressive operating performance and the cash-generating strength of our portfolio.
At year-end, our cash balances totaled $20 billion, up $3 billion from the end of 2010. This put us in a net cash
position of about $10 billion. Our strong cash flow and solid balance sheet continue to be competitive advantages.
Turning to Slide 6, I'll compare results of the fourth quarter 2011 with the third quarter 2011. As a reminder, our
earnings press release compares fourth quarter 2011 with the same quarter a year ago.
Fourth quarter earnings were $5.1 billion, $2.7 billion lower than third quarter earnings. Upstream earnings were
down $464 million, driven by an unfavorable swing in foreign exchange effects and higher operating expenses,
partly offset by higher volumes. Downstream results decreased $2 billion between quarters, resulting from weaker
margins, the absence of asset sale gains, lower volumes, and an unfavorable swing of foreign exchange effects. The
variance in the Other bar reflects higher corporate charges.
On Slide 7, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the fourth quarter were $97 million higher than the third quarter's
result. Higher realizations benefited earnings by $60 million. A 4% increase in crude oil realizations improved
earnings by about $100 million, while a 13% drop in natural gas realizations reduced earnings by about $40
million.
Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $65 million between periods, primarily due to higher employee
costs and increased maintenance activity. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including gains on
several small asset sales.
Turning to Slide 8, International Upstream earnings were down $561 million relative to the third quarter. A net
positive liftings variance across multiple countries increased earnings by $180 million. Higher operating expenses
reduced earnings by $165 million, driven primarily by an increase in employee and maintenance expenses.
Tax items across multiple jurisdictions decreased earnings by $100 million between quarters. This net number
includes the absence of the one-time catch-up charge booked in the third quarter due to our retroactive tax
increase in the UK.
An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects lowered earnings by about $305 million. The U.S. dollar
weakened against many currencies, most notably the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. The fourth
quarter had a foreign exchange loss of around $3 million, compared to a gain of about 300 million in the third
quarter. These foreign exchange effects have minimal impact on cash, as we've said before. They are primarily
balance sheet translation effects.

The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including lower realizations and higher exploration expense
associated with seismic acquisition costs across the portfolio, as well as some well write-off in China and Angola.
Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Between quarters,
production increased 42,000 barrels a day. Lower prices improved volumes under production sharing and
variable royalty contracts during the fourth quarter, increasing production about 4,000 barrels a day. Base
business, combined with external constraints, increased production a net 6,000 barrels a day.
Tengiz returned to normal operations following a turnaround activity in the third quarter, but the impact of this
full restoration was partly offset by some unplanned downtime in December. Production in Thailand was also fully
restored following a June third-party pipeline incident, only to be partly offset by lower demand as a result of
flooding and seasonality in the fourth quarter. Offsetting these net positive impacts were normal field declines and
an extended turnaround in Trinidad.
On the third quarter earnings call, we told you we expected fourth quarter production to increase to
approximately 100,000 to 150,000 barrels per day. Obviously, our forecast did not include the negative impacts of
the events I just mentioned.
Moving to the next bar, incremental production from major capital projects increased fourth quarter production
by 32,000 barrels a day, primarily driven by the start-up of Platong II in Thailand and improved reliability at
Perdido.
Slide 10 compares full-year 2011 net oil equivalent production to that of 2010. Production decreased 90,000
barrels a day. Price impacts from production sharing and variable royalty contracts decreased production by
32,000 barrels a day. The average Brent price increased about $32 in 2011. For the full year, each dollar increase
in Brent resulted in a 1,000 barrel per day volume reduction.
Base business, combined with external constraints, lowered production by 103,000 barrels per day. Normal field
declines and higher maintenance activity were partly offset by about 17,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent from
our recently acquired Marcellus assets. Our decline rate for the year was about 4%, right in line with our prior
guidance.
Incremental production from our major capital projects contributed 45,000 barrels per day, [ph] due to the
(11:58) start-up of Platong II in Thailand and the ramp-up of AOSP in Canada, Frade in Brazil, and Perdido in the
Gulf of Mexico.
Our original production guidance for 2011 was 2.79 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. We fell short of that
guidance by about 115,000 barrels a day. About a third of that is due to higher prices. About a third is due to
lower-than-expected major capital project performance, mostly Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico and TombuaLandana in Angola. And the remaining third is lower base business performance, about half of which is due to the
third-party pipeline rupture and decreased demand in Thailand. As John mentioned, our focus is on profitable
barrels. For the year, our global Upstream earned over $26 per barrel. This is an increase of over $8 per barrel
from our 2010 results. We have led our peer group on this metric for over two years by a wide margin, and we
expect the trend to continue as our competitors announce their fourth quarter results.
Turning now to Slide 11. U.S. Downstream earnings decreased $908 million in the fourth quarter. Margins
dramatically weakened between quarters, lowering earnings by about $400 million. General industry fuel margins
fell, contributing about half the decline shown in the bar. Seasonal declines in base oil and finished lubricants
demand also punished fourth quarter margins. Maintenance at our Richmond, California, and Pascagoula,

Mississippi, refineries also impacted margins and was the primary driver for lower produced volumes, which
decreased earnings by about $200 million. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $155 million,
resulting from increased employee costs and maintenance activity I just mentioned, along with associated higher
transportation costs. Chemical earnings decreased by $80 million due to both lower margins and lower sales
volumes. The Other bar consists of several unrelated items, including the absence of third quarter asset sales,
negative LIFO effects, and lower trading results.
On Slide 12, International Downstream earnings were $1.1 billion lower this quarter. Refining and marketing
margins fell, reducing earnings by $155 million. This reflected weaker Asian demand, coupled with regional
recovery from shutdowns. The next bar shows the $570 million negative earnings variance, primarily reflecting
the absence of the third quarter gain on the sale of the Pembroke refinery and related marketing facilities in the
UK and Ireland. A swing in foreign currency effects reduced earnings by $230 million. The U.S. dollar weakened
against both the Korean won and the Australian dollar during the quarter. Fourth quarter's foreign exchange loss
was about $85 million compared to the third quarter gain of about $145 million. The Other bar here reflects a
number of unrelated items, including lower chemical and trading results and higher operating expenses.
Slide 13 covers all other. Fourth quarter net charges were $553 million, compared to a net $358 million charge in
the third quarter. This is an increase of $195 million in charges between periods. A favorable swing in corporate
tax items resulted in a $30 million benefit to earnings. Corporate costs were $225 million higher this quarter. For
the full year, this segment had net charges of $1.5 billion, putting us at the upper range of our $250 million to
$350 million guidance range. We believe going forward, a higher range of $300 million to $400 million is more
appropriate.
With that, I'd like to now turn it back over to John for a few thoughts on 2012.

Okay. Thanks, Pat.
Turning to Slide 14, in early December, we announced our capital program for 2012 at $32.7 billion. The 2012
program is in line with our overall 2011 investments once the Atlas acquisition is included. We continue to develop
an enviable project queue with almost 90% of the program earmarked for Upstream activity. We are progressing
construction on our two world-class Australian LNG products and Deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments. We
are planning for increased exploration activity around the world, along with additional work to further assess the
Marcellus and Utica acreage we acquired this past year. The investments we're making today are on track to
deliver significant production growth by mid-decade, which is expected to generate substantial cash flow over a
long period of time. Our downstream investments for 2012 will focus on the construction of a premium base oil
plant at our Pascagoula refinery and improving downstream returns through a number of energy efficiency and
feedstock flexibility projects.
Turning to Slide 15, this slide shows our net production outlook for 2012. Our full-year outlook for 2012 is 2.68
million barrels of oil equivalent per day, essentially flat with 2011. The outlook assumes an average Brent price of
$111 per barrel, the same average price as 2011, and does not assume OPEC curtailments, materials security, or
market impacts. Major capital project start-ups, including Angola LNG and Usan, are expected to be largely offset
by base business decline and major turnaround activity at Tengiz. 2012 will be the first major plant turnaround for
the SGI/SGP facility since start-up in 2008. We expect the turnaround to occur in the third quarter and last
approximately six weeks. Base business decline is expected to be about 4%.

Looking beyond 2012, I want to remind you of our long-term guidance. At the end of 2009, we said we expected to
grow production, adjusted for price impacts, about 1% per year through 2014 and then grow 4% to 5% thereafter.
We exceeded the 1% rate in 2010. We're a bit below in 2011, but overall on track to meet our goals. With the
strength and scale of our major capital projects and our strong base business performance, we continue to expect
production to grow to 3.3 million barrels per day by 2017. We're advancing the queue, reaching critical milestones,
and are well positioned to deliver consistent growth and performance over the long term.
Looking forward, let me highlight some the activities we have planned for 2012 on Slide 17. In the Downstream,
we will mark the final year of our three-year plan to improve returns. We're well on track to deliver on the
commitments we made when we first began our restructuring program. Construction on the Pascagoula base oil
plant continues, driving toward a 2013 start-up. We're on track for start-up of two major capital projects, Angola
LNG and the Usan deepwater project in Nigeria. We expect increased exploration activity in both our core focus
areas and some intriguing test areas around the globe. We expect to enter the front-end engineering and design
phase of the Future Growth Project at Tengiz, the steamflood pilot expansion in the Partitioned Zone, and our first
expansion of Gorgon in Australia.
In 2012, we will have a laser-sharp focus on execution as we continue construction on our Australia LNG and
deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. I look forward to further discussing these plans in more detail at our security
analyst meeting on March 13 in New York City. We had a great 2011, and we're looking forward to delivering some
strong results in 2012.
Now, that concludes my prepared remarks. We're now set to take some questions. So, Sean, if you'll please open
the lines for those questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Absolutely, thank you. [Operator Instructions] . Our first question comes from Paul Sankey with
Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.

Q

Hi, John. It's been a tough few weeks for news flow, clearly. Could you just underline for us the resolution that we
now have on, firstly, the situation in Brazil, the extent to which there's any more potential news flow from the
spill, or whether or not that's essentially got a line drawn underneath it? The same for Nigeria. And then finally, if
you could address the recent legal news flow around Ecuador and where we are in that whole process, I would be
grateful. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. Let me first talk about Brazil. As many of you know, we had a seep there from well-drilling activity in
November. And I would tell you this is less a drilling issue as it is a subsurface issue. We were drilling a well in the
project – remember, we've had over 50 well penetrations in this field and know it pretty well. We hit pressure that
was higher than we expected, took a kick. And our people responded in textbook fashion to control that kick.
Weighting up the mud, et cetera. Within – it took us some time to identify that seeps were, as a result of that kick,
in the first couple of days. We had sent ROVs down the first day and didn't see anything around our wells.
Remember, these are subsea wells. And there was nothing around the FPSO. We sent the ROV down again and

saw these seeps. And so we commenced a significant action at that time to control the surface sheen that we were
seeing and to control the seeps. And that has been largely a very successful effort.
Now, during that time, you saw some very strong reaction by regulators and in the media. I would tell you we
didn't necessarily put our best foot forward in some of the communication that we made at that time. But the
event itself was handled in textbook fashion. Now, since that time, we've been working very closely to improve the
communications with regulators and to get them the necessary information that they need. But like the United
States and some other countries, there are many different factions in Brazil, and there are a number of political
issues around oil development, from the environmental community, between the state and federal level. And so
you have a lot of different views on oil development, and there are many forces at work in Brazil.
We're doing our best to deal with the circumstance. I can't predict what may come. What I do know is the facts
would suggest that our people responded very well to this event. And all we'd asked is to be treated fairly,
consistent with the facts, and to be treated as Petrobras or others would be treated in a similar circumstance.
In terms of Nigeria, the Nigerian event is a serious event, and very concerned about it. Obviously, we had two
fatalities from that incident. I'm pleased that the evacuation that was put in place was fairly orderly and that 152
individuals were able to escape. As you might imagine, our first priority was dealing with those 152 individuals
and searching for the two that proved to be lost. We've been conducting interviews with those individuals to try to
better understand what happened.
We have said that we had thought that there was some type of an equipment failure on surface facilities. What we
know is that there were gas returns from the formation through the annulus that were being circulated out
through the mud/gas separator. This is not at all unusual. This is a fairly routine type of activity. But then
something went wrong. And we don't know a lot more about it than that. We're doing a root cause analysis. We're
trying to piece through the information that we're getting to better understand it.
But our real focus right now is really on putting out the fire that continues to this day. As you probably read in the
material we put out, we mobilized two rigs to drill relief wells. One is more a precaution. We presume the first will
be successful, but in the event that it encounters any challenges, we've got a second. We've received considerable
help from the industry in making those rigs available, which we're pleased with. And we're doing well planning
right now. I would expect we would spud one of those relief wells within the next week or so. We have seen the
size of the flame go down significantly since the initial event, but we're monitoring that as we go. I'll remind you,
this is a gas well that's burning. You do see a plume around the site. That's silt and mud, as it's being – it's a very
shallow site. It's 40 feet of water, and so as the gas comes up, a lot of silt and mud is being disturbed, and so you
see that plume. We've been sampling that. That's mud. And that will eventually dissipate and settle to the bottom.
So more work under way.
Certainly I'm concerned about these events. They're fairly different events, as I indicated. The one in Brazil, I
would categorize more as a geologic event than drilling related. The one in Nigeria is clearly related to drilling
activities and surface activities. We'll continue to do what we always do in these circumstances. We'll work very
hard to understand. We've got a root cause analysis team that's been flown in from around the world to
understand it. We've taken actions, as you might expect, with stand-downs in our drilling organization,
reinforcing well control standards. And that's on top of many of the proprietary things that we do. But certainly
I'm very disappointed in those particular events.
Now, when it comes to Ecuador, that has been in the news as well. I won't go through the case in great detail,
because I think most of you know the history. If you're on the phone and you don't, I encourage you to look at our
website, because we have quite a bit of information, and I think it's generally acknowledged that this case is a
product of fraud. Most of us know that. This is a collaboration between corrupt plaintiffs lawyers in the U.S. and a
corrupt judiciary in Ecuador. Nonetheless, we're moving it through the judicial system.
There have been events in really three courts recently. One in Ecuador, one in New York, and one in The Hague.
So I'll quickly tell you what's happened in each one. On January 3, a panel of three temporary judges overseeing
our appeal of the Lago Agrio verdict in Ecuador upheld that original ruling. So on January 20, Chevron filed an
appeal seeking review by Ecuador's National Court of Justice. Basically, we're pursuing all available procedural
steps in Ecuador, as you would expect. Remember, we have no assets in Ecuador.
So the second area where there's been court activity has been in The Hague. On January 25, the BIT Tribunal –
that is, the Bilateral Investment Treaty Tribunal in The Hague – converted its previous interim measures order to
an interim award, and that makes it have more standing in the international community. And basically the award
is targeted at the Republic of Ecuador and says that Ecuador is obligated to prevent enforcement worldwide
pending a full review and formal trial on the merits of the case. This award is helpful to us in preventing
enforcement outside of Ecuador. I would also point out that in previous rulings that the Tribunal has made, they
have already indicated that Ecuador will be financially responsible for all the damage caused by this fraud if
Chevron prevails. So it's – we've had some strong wording out of that court and are encouraged by that. And
there's another hearing scheduled.
And then finally, on January 26 in New York, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued an opinion reversing and vacating
the Southern District Court's injunction. We had sought to stop enforcement in U.S. courts, stop the plaintiffs
from enforcing any judgment that might be achieved in Ecuador in courts outside the United States. And in a
fairly narrow procedural ruling, the courts held that that statute cannot be implied for purpose of such
enforcement. But it was a fairly narrow procedural ruling, and it doesn't change – in fact, it made no comments
about the merits of the case. And in fact, it made no comment about the RICO case. And so you can expect that
that will continue on its way.
I know this can be confusing. We said at the outset with this case that when you have collusion in a fraud outside
of the United States, you have to work many avenues to protect yourself. We have – we still have many defenses,
both in Ecuador, in The Hague, and elsewhere, where we've put together defense teams should enforcement be
sought elsewhere. It's certainly unfortunate that we're at this point, but when you have an elaborate fraud that's
being perpetrated against you, that's what you have to do. So I hope that wasn't too long an update on those three
matters.

Q

Thank you, John. I mean, my follow-up would simply be the – what are the next dates or events that we should
look for as the next sort of meaningful news flow items on those three issues as we go into 2012? And I'll leave it
there. Thank you, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, at some point, we'll hear a final determination in Ecuador. I'll leave that to you to decide what you think will
happen there. There could be more out of the BIT Tribunal, and then there could be more actions that we could
take in New York under the RICO case. So that's where we are.

And dates on more news flow from Nigeria and -?

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

You know, those are hard to predict. I think – we'll notify you, for example, when we spud the relief well. To some
degree, events will dictate where we put out news. But any significant change in the status of the well or the status
of the work we're doing, we'll certainly keep you apprised. And for those that haven't seen it, we're putting up
pretty regular updates on our website on both Brazil and Nigeria.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Go ahead with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ed G. Westlake
Analyst, Credit Suisse (United States)

Q

Hey, good morning, John and Pat. You mentioned, Pat, that $10 billion on the balance sheet continues to provide
Chevron with competitive advantages. I guess only if you're going to do something with the cash; obviously longrange growth target's unchanged. So just some color, perhaps, on – is it because portfolio options for additional
spend are not yet matured? Is it because you're worried about inflation in terms of the existing projects you have?
Or are you thinking perhaps U.S. gas prices being so weak will present a strategic opportunity for you guys?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, let me make a few comments, because we have some priorities for our cash. Clearly we have a strong balance
sheet, one of the strongest in the industry. We're heading into a period where we have significant capital
expenditures ahead of us. And I've said previously that we want to be sure that we can execute this group of major
capital projects uninterrupted. And you can have considerable volatility in the commodity markets. So even
though we may think oil prices will be more than adequate to preserve our cash status so that we can fund these
capital projects, we have a more conservative balance sheet than might otherwise be the case to ensure that we can
execute these major capital projects. That's, I guess, number one that I would tell you. We want to be able to fund
these projects.
We, of course, want to be able to continue to pay the dividend and increase the dividend as the pattern of earnings
and cash flow permit going forward. And then we have further flexibility to repurchase shares if cash gets above
the rate that we think affords us those protections. And we have. and as you've seen, we have done that.
We're not saving it for a particular purpose. We are opportunistic when it comes to opportunities to add to the
portfolio, and we want to be in a position of having sufficient resources to be able to take advantage of an
opportunity. You've seen last year, we made small acquisitions in the Marcellus and add-on, bolt-on acquisitions.
And the balance sheet that we have affords us that sort of flexibility. We don't have to do any acquisitions, but
we're in a position to take advantage of opportunities with the balance sheet that we have. So that's kind of the
priorities that we have for the cash-debt balance that we have today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ed G. Westlake
Analyst, Credit Suisse (United States)

Q

And maybe a follow-on, then. So Gorgon, Wheatstone, and Jack/St. Malo are some of the – Big Foot – some of the
big projects. Gorgon, I think, maybe towards the end of this year, you'll be in a more comfortable position in terms
of really understanding productivity, and the ultimate cost of that project probably provides a read-through to
Wheatstone. So at that point, would you be more comfortable to say, okay, we've got through the hump of the
CapEx and we could maybe return cash to shareholders or do something different?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

I think you hit it about right in terms of the sort of understanding what – costs, if you will. If you look at
Wheatstone – I just had an update last night with the project team, for example, in both Gorgon and Wheatstone.
I meet with them – once a month, I meet with the project manager and line management and had a pretty
thorough update on where we are at Gorgon. And we're 36% complete now. It's going very well, other than a
cyclone is descending on Barrow Island as we speak. That's one of the things that we deal with. We have hardened
facilities there. So we'll manage our way through that. But the project is going very well. 36% complete, and I'll
just tell you on the – we're on track for kind of late 2014 start-up of Gorgon and feel pretty good about the
progress that we have made on that flagship project.
From a cost point of view, and maybe this is what you were getting at, we will – this will be the first year where
we'll have a lot of on-island activity. And so we'll get a good chance to understand labor productivity and the
progress that we're making. That, coupled with impacts of foreign exchange, for example, will dictate whether
there's any change to costs one way or another. At this point, the $37 billion is the target for the project, and if we
have anything more to say, it's – probably be more later in the year.
So on the subject of will we change our balance sheet structure as the year wears on, I think it's fair to say that as
we get closer to start-up of these big projects – remember, we've got Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack/St. Malo, Big
Foot, Tubular Bells, that all start up in that – Wheatstone's a little later – but the big ones in the 2014 timeframe.
As we get closer to that date, the need for flexibility on the balance sheet diminishes, and then we'll have choices
for what we do with that additional cash.

Q

John, you outlined a number of the big projects – Australia LNG, deepwater, you got big international projects.
The big, glaring hole is U.S. shale and U.S. liquids shale in particular. You do have the Marcellus, but as some of
these opportunities start to expand and mature, they do actually look quite substantial. I'm curious how you – if
you can provide some comments on how you do – thinking about addressing that seeming hole in your portfolio?
There are a lot of jobs that come with these projects. There's a lot of opportunity to invest here in America. You are
the second-largest energy company in the U.S. Between the inherent investment opportunity and some of the
other benefits of investing here, how do you see that as a strategic need for Chevron? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, yeah, sure, Arjun. Look, we're very positive on shale. As you know very well, the shale gas business in this
country was really built by the independents because you had to have strong land departments. And so major
companies got involved by buying their way in. And so prices began to run up, and we felt – we always were
focused on value. No matter how much we might like rocks, we're always very focused on value.
And many have plunged in with big dollars, and perhaps those will prove to be money well spent. For our view, we
had some pretty strict criteria, and we have made some targeted acquisitions at areas where we know we have a
low cost basis of doing business, including substantial carry to cushion us through a difficult period in the gas
market.
I guess I'd point out that we have some 8 million acres of shale around the world. And in March, you'll hear
George give you an update on not just the Marcellus and Utica shales, but also some of the things we're working in
West Texas and otherwise. So we feel pretty good about our portfolio. We have opportunities overseas. We're just
drilling a well in Poland. We're drilling a well, in fact our second well, in the Duvernay in Canada. So I think we
have a little more than might be commonly recognized. But it's – we're not ideologically against these things, and
we have some acreage that we've had for a long time that's held by production in the Delaware Basin, et cetera,
that shows some promise as well.
So I think we'll have an opportunity in March, Arjun, to give you a more thorough update of what we have. But
we're not ideologically opposed to shales. We just want to enter in a way where we can generate some value.

Q

John, I realize there's sort of no absolute answer here in the sense that it's always case-by-case specific, but we've
generally presumed some of the joint ventures that some the international and non-U.S. companies have done are
probably inherently less likely for Chevron to pursue. Is that true? And then the related follow-up is do you feel a
need to add expertise via adding employees of other companies, potentially, in terms of pursuing U.S.
opportunities? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

I think it's fair to say that if we were going to take on a significant new opportunity in the U.S., organizational
capability would be a consideration. When we acquired Atlas, we picked up some very good people with that, and
that was very, very helpful to us. Certainly, manpower is at a premium. So I think that is an important part of what
we're looking for. So what was the other part of your question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Arjun Narayana Murti
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.

Just on joint ventures. Again, that's been a avenue for some folks. We've thought it as less likely for you all.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, there are two aspects to the joint venture. One is if you come in and are carrying the partner or the operator,
you're paying a disproportionate level of cost. And with the gas market where it is, that's going to be difficult
financially for a period of time. We acquired Atlas, and that came with a carry. So we like that better. Second,
coming in as a non-operator isn't our preferred approach. If we were going to apply our expertise, we would rather
have some degree of [ph] control. (41:07)
We look at a lot of these different ventures, and you had to come in with money, and you had to come in and really
have the pace and activity and practices dictated by non-operators. And in many cases, those were operators we
didn't want to be in that position with.

Q

Evan Calio
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

John, I know you guys have an increase in exploration activity this year. I was wondering if you could provide an
update on exploration, in particular, Liberia, Bear's Hump, and [ph] Peyson (41:46) in the Gulf of Mexico, where I
think you have four to five rigs working today, and/or some of the shale positions that you mentioned, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. We do have quite a bit of exploration activity this year. As you know, we've been accumulating acreage over
the last several years. So where are we drilling wells this year? We have a key well that will be spudded shortly in
Liberia. We've talked about that. We've got a well drilling now in China. That's a very encouraging well. We've got
a well drilling now in Poland. We've got well drilling now in the Duvernay up in Canada. So we have, certainly,
those that are under way. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have four rigs currently. I should note, we have had one dry
hole in China. So we're on our second well there. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have four rigs currently. Right now,
they're all working on development activity. But we do have exploration wells ahead. We were unable to get the
Coronado well down, so we're looking for a new location and a new opportunity to drill that well. And so those are
some the highlights that I would offer in the portfolio this year. We will have some tests in the Utica that we'll drill
this year, and so that's encouraging, and more in the Duvernay.

Evan Calio

Q

For sure, for sure. The second question I have – can you tell me the reserve bookings related to Wheatstone? And
then with your recent discovery in addition to the five others, that could support, I think, 11 straight right now –
that could support a third train in Wheatstone. I mean, how will that process develop in 2012, as well as any
potential Gorgon expansion, where I believe you have space for five trains? I'm just thinking you could see within
the existing portfolio even an extended growth beyond 2017.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Oh, to be sure. First, the Wheatstone booking was 740 million barrels, and so obviously that was a significant
contributor to our reserve adds for the year. In terms of what's likely to come next, we have three trains at Gorgon,
two in the foundation project at Wheatstone. The most likely next step is a fourth train at Gorgon, and whether we
can get to a fifth train on Barrow Island will remain to be seen. We believe we have the plot space. But subsequent
trains at Wheatstone will likely then follow the fourth train at Gorgon. And that will be a function of the resources
that we have accumulated and any third-party activity. Remember, that's a hub site, and so it'll also be a function
of resources that we can bring to that site, which bring down fixed costs, and we're actively working that aspect as
well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason D. Gammel
Analyst, Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.

Q

Thanks very much. First of all, on reserve replacement, John, obviously a big number at Wheatstone. But even
[ph] directing (45:25) that out, it looks like just under 100% replacement from all other sources.
Are you able to provide any further breakdown of the geographic reserve adds? And I think specifically, I would be
looking at deepwater Gulf of Mexico, because I believe last year, there were some price implications that
prevented you from booking some of the reserves associated with the projects that are moving forward there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. We did make a booking on Jack/St. Malo this year. And so – in fact, if you look at the typical categories of
extensions, et cetera, all the categories of reserve movement were positive, other than the impact of price and
obviously production during the year. So Big Foot, we also made a booking this year. You'll see more as we – in
the Annual Report when we disclose it.

But it was fairly broad-based. We did have bookings in the Marcellus as a result of our activity there as well. So it
was fairly broad-based and positive.
I'll just remind you, these things are lumpy. A year ago, when our bookings were a little bit low, we said these
things are lumpy, and it's a function of largely major capital project timing. But we're also doing a lot of very good
work in reservoir management to be sure that we're getting the necessary technical work done to book reserves as
fast as we can, when we know developments are coming and they're really waiting on technical work or
determinations to meet bookings standards.
So the reservoir management group continues to do good work around the company.

Jason D. Gammel

Q

That's great. And if I could – with the second question, Upstream margins, obviously comparing you against many
of your peers, they've been fantastic. But if I look at the fourth quarter and compare it to your own good history,
I'm actually looking at capturing about 21% of the Brent price, whereas you'd been capturing pretty consistently
between 23% and 24% of the Brent price, really just referring specifically to the International margin.
Is there anything going on in the quarter that makes it non-representational, or should we be looking at the
potential for cost inflation to start eroding that great margin that you had established over the course of 2011?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. Jason, I think I'll take this one, if you don't mind.
So realizations generally were relatively flat globally there. We had higher exploration expense. I mentioned the
seismic activity and the well write-offs that we had. So fourth quarter was a little bit higher on exploration
expense. We also had higher operating expenses; I mentioned that. And then there was additional charges, onetime charges, tax-related charges, in the fourth quarter that you would not see recur again.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

I think the general message I would give you is there hasn't been something fundamentally changed in our
portfolio. We have a strong portfolio. It will continue to perform well, particularly with high oil prices.

And in March, you'll see us talk a little bit more about our portfolio and some of the new projects coming in.
Because the new projects are very good also, and they are high return per barrel.
So naturally we've got a range of profitability across the portfolio, but on balance, we think this lead we have is
something we're very likely to keep in the kind of oil price environment, and particularly with the sort of North
America gas prices that we're seeing.

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

John and Pat and Jeanette, several questions, if I could.
Pat, can you give us a rough idea that how the CapEx trend is going to look like from 2013 until 2017? I presume
that there's a number of projects you still need to sanction, and that you're probably not going to see any relief, so
should we assume that it's going to be up, say, a couple billion dollars on average a year, comparing to this year
level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. Paul, if I can comment, the major spend projects we've sanctioned and – are under way. And we're heading
into a period of heavy construction: Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot – all of those projects are kind
of in their high-spend period in the period 2012 to 2014. So that's when you should be looking to see kind of –
those are likely to be high-spend years.
And we've given you the number for 2012. We haven't given numbers beyond that. But I would just say that period
is likely to be the three-year period.
The next big project that will add a big tranche of cost is likely to be the Future Growth Project at Tengiz, and
we're likely to begin progressing that. But that's slated for start-up 2017 or later, kind of time period. And so that
peak spend will likely be later in the time period.

And same thing goes for the steamflood project in the Partitioned Zone, which would be a significant spend. That's
behind these big projects. So I wouldn't look for a major tranche of increase from beyond what we've talked about
during this period.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

And, John, if we're looking at all the noise surrounding your oil spill in Brazil and also the last couple years,
there's sort of a little bit change in the political wind, how they treat the foreign oil company in the country. All
those add together, does that change your view about the commitment of the – or I shouldn't use the word
commitment, but the appetite of the company in that country?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, let me make a broader comment. I think that host governments, whether it's the United States, China, or
Brazil, have very high expectations for companies like ours. They expect the best. We trade on our reputation, and
– us and frankly other IOCs trade on our reputation. And so we get held to a very high standard. They expect
excellence from us.
And when they don't see it, they come down hard. And we've seen that take place elsewhere. So that's part of what
the expectation is. And we need to not put oil in the water, and that's what we work to do every day.
So expectations are high. Transparency is high. And anyone who has an agenda that might not be consistent with
our objectives is going to point out any flaws or mistakes that we make. So we should expect that. And we have to
deal with it.
We do work very hard to get balance and facts out into these circumstances, and assume that rule of law and
consistent treatment will prevail. But certainly expectations are higher today than they might have been two or
three years ago.
Why don't we go ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Yeah. And just on the resource base, I understand it's lumpy in terms of moving into the [ph] proven reserves.
(52:37) Do you have a rough estimate you can give us between 2012 to 2015, how much [ph] of your existing
probable resource that you can prove into the proven reserves (52:48) on the major projects?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

You know, I don't have it. I mean, I would tell you, over time, we're obviously targeting to replace more than 100%
of reserves, but I don't have a particular target for you.
George will give you a little bigger breakdown on – you'll recall last year, he talked about some of our big projects

then I have a follow-up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. Mark, as you know, the project was originally designed to bring gas to the United States. We've been
working with Sonangol and our other partners to put in place a diversion program, which of course makes sense,
given the markets in Europe and Asia. And I expect that over time, we'll have the flexibility to move gas to those
markets. So that's basically the plan for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark Gilman

John, if I could just follow up on that, are there any short-term contracts you have in place to move that gas to
Asia?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

We're in the process of contracting kind of as we speak. And so I don't have, for example, a destination for the first
cargo to share with you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark Gilman
Analyst, The Benchmark Co. LLC

Q

Okay. My follow-up relates to the 2012 production forecast. I'm wondering, are there any production-sharing
contract thresholds that have entered into that number?
And if you could be a little bit more specific in terms of what the volumetric impact might be of the TombuaLandana disappointment, as well as the major Tengiz turn. Is that a full-plant turn for six weeks so it'll be
completely shut down, or it is something less than that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

It is a full-plant turnaround. So it's a very significant event.
In terms of other PSC effects, the PSC effects can vary by price. So there are different impacts in the $70 range and
the $90 range and the $110 range. So they do vary. But I'm not going to get into the specifics of those. Jeanette
may have a comment here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeanette Ourada

Mark, I think you were asking were we going to hit any PSC triggers in 2012. And there's no major trigger in our
forecast that we're expecting.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John S. Watson

A

Performance hasn't been up to what we had expected, and we're dealing with it, to see if we can resolve some of
the issues. But the production's a little shy of – what we said is production was a little bit shy of what we had built
in the plan this year.

Q

Iain S. Reid
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Could I ask a couple questions again on LNG? You took FID on Wheatstone with, I think, kind of industry low in
terms of the amount of gas which had been marketed. Are you keeping some of this back for your own marketing
operation, or do you intend to contract that completely, say, during this year?
And secondly, on Browse, this one seems to be slipping quite a long way down the program in Australia. Is this a
project now you've kind of put in post-2020 start-up frame given the difficulty there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, a couple comments. First, we've been pretty successful in our gas marketing. We're about 70% under SPA at
Gorgon, about 60% in Wheatstone, and we continue to have good conversations with gas customers.
Recall, some have been impacted by – some of the contracting has been impacted by the events around
Fukushima. So it's been a very sensitive and difficult time for some of the Japanese customers.
So I expect that as we move along, we'll get into the 85%, 90% range. And every indication I have based on my
conversations with our gas people is that particularly with some of the events taking place around the world,
there's plenty of demand out there at similar pricing to what we're seeing today.
But we're at 60% at Wheatstone, and I expect we'll move forward successfully.

Browse.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Oh, and, Browse. Browse – I'm probably best referring you to Woodside, who's the operator there.
I think the intent of the partnership is to keep the retention licenses in place. Remember, there were some
conditions that were put on development. There were some actions that were required of the partnership in order
to retain the retention licenses. And the partners have been working through the economics of the scheme that
was put forward by the operator, and so I don't want to prejudge or comment on that.

I'll just say that we're committed – we're certainly committed to developing the resource, and it has to be done in
an economic way. But I probably need to leave that to Woodside, as they're the operator.

Thanks, John. Could I ask just one very quick follow-up on something you answered earlier in terms of the impact
of the Tengiz Future Growth Project on future CapEx. Are you basically saying to us that $30 billion, $33 billion is
kind of where Chevron is going to be for the next six, seven years in terms of overall spend?

No, I didn't say that. What I said was 2012, 2013, and 2014 are peak years because of the LNG projects. And if you
simply did math and took out those expenditures, you would see a big drop-off. But we continually add items into
the hopper, and the Future Growth Project is one of those. But it doesn't mean spending will necessarily be at this
$33 billion level.
Okay, I'm going to take one last question from our next person. Thank you.

Q

I believe in – last year when you guys put out your original budget for 2011, you talked about $26 billion budget,
and you came in at $29 billion for 2011. So can you talk about what caused that budget for – or caused the number
for 2011 to be higher than your original budget? And you can also talk about for 2012, what the major variables are
that can influence the budget for 2012 as we get to the end of the year?

Sure. I'll let Pat take that one.

Okay, yeah. So principally, there were two items that I'd call your attention to. One, we did a little bit of coring up
around the Atlas acquisition property. So a little bit of coring up around the Marcellus. That was not planned at
the time we put out the original target there. And I would also say, because of the strong price environment,
particularly in the U.S., we've had additional activity in the U.S. And that led to – those two items really account
for that increase of about $3 billion.
In terms of any other outlook changes that we've got relative to the planned [ph] C&E (1:00:11) target for 2012,
there's nothing that comes to mind that we need to update you about. We feel good about the $32.7 billion figure
that we put out.

Q

Faisel H. Khan

Okay, then on your guidance for corporate expense, you said that was going to be a little bit higher this year versus
kind of last year. Is it the major incidences, kind of between Nigeria and Brazil, that are influencing that corporate
expense number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

No. Actually, if you look back, we have had the corporate guidance in that sector be $250 million to $350 million
for quite some time – several years in fact. And all I was really trying to do was acknowledge the fact that we do
have corporate departments whose salaries go up a little bit over time. In this particular case, we had some
additional pension expense that's related to the funding position of our pension. And I expect a little bit of that to
be higher in 2012. So it's really just trying to give you a little bit of better guidance.

Okay. And lastly, on the Coronado, you said the well was not able to get down, or you did not drill the well on
Coronado?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

John S. Watson
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

We drilled the well. We weren't able to get down. It couldn't get through the salt.
