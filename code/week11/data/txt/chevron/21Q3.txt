Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to
Chevron's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that
time. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr.
Roderick Green. Please go ahead.

Roderick Green
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call. I'm Roderick Green, GM of
Investor Relations. And on the call with me today are Mark Nelson, EVP of Downstream & Chemicals, and Pierre
Breber, CFO, who will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2.
Now, I'll turn it over to Pierre.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Roderick. We reported third quarter earnings of $6.1 billion or $3.19 per share, highest reported earnings
in more than eight years. Adjusted earnings were $5.7 billion or $2.96 per share. The quarter's results included
two special items, asset sale gains of $200 million and pension settlement costs of $81 million. A reconciliation of
non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.
Adjusted ROCE was greater than 13% and we lowered our net debt ratio to below 19%. Strong operating cash
flow enabled us to deliver on our financial priorities, including the resumption of share repurchases. Compared to
before COVID, operating costs are down, Upstream production is up and we're much more capital efficient.
Cost efficiency and capital efficiency are essential to navigate commodity price cycles, providing resilience
through the low periods and leveraging upside when markets are strong. This has been evident over the past
several quarters and especially so in the most recent one as we generated company-record free cash flow, higher
than the strongest quarters in 2008 and 2011 when oil prices were well over $100 a barrel.
Adjusted third quarter earnings were up more than $5 billion versus last year primarily on higher prices, margins
and volumes. Compared with the last quarter, adjusted third quarter earnings were up almost $2.5 billion.
Adjusted Upstream earnings increased on higher realizations and positive timing effects primarily related to
managing LNG portfolio pricing exposure. Adjusted Downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining
and marketing margins.

The All Other variance was positive due to lower corporate charges and the use of deferred tax assets which
previously had a valuation allowance. Third quarter oil equivalent production increased 7% year-over-year due to
the Noble acquisition and lower curtailments partly offset by price-related entitlement effects and asset sales.
I'll now pass it over to Mark.

Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Pierre. In Downstream & Chemicals, we delivered our best adjusted earnings in more than four years.
Demand for our products is strong with recovery of jet fuel sales expected as international travel gradually returns.
And while the improving market environment helps, we're focused on what we can control, safe and reliable
operations, capital and cost efficiency and value chain optimization to drive higher returns.
Some examples of our self-help actions include using digital tools to improve planning, scheduling and
prioritization of maintenance activity, leveraging data analytics and asset flexibility to increase margins and
adopting new technologies like robotic inspections and maintenance procedures. During our Investor Day in
March, I highlighted this self-help is expected to drive higher returns for Downstream & Chemicals. We're on track
to meet that guidance with benefits already flowing to the bottom line.
Chemicals performance is also strong as CPChem responds to current market conditions while continuing to keep
a focus on longer-term unit cost reduction. GS Caltex reached 100% design capacity of its mixed-feed cracker
ahead of schedule and under budget. The CPChem US Gulf Coast II project continues to advance towards a final
investment decision in a disciplined way that positions the project to earn attractive returns through the cycle. And
the Ras Laffan Project is in FEED and we continue to evaluate this project.
We believe in the long-term fundamentals of Chemicals. Our investment focus continues to be on the low end of
the supply cost curve, the advantaged feedstock, competitive capital and cost structure and strong project
execution. Since our Energy Transition Spotlight, we've closed the acquisition of an equity interest in American
Natural Gas and its network of 60 CNG retail sites with our partner, Mercuria, enabling us to meet customers'
needs beyond California.
We're also delivering first gas through our Brightmark partnership and all CalBioGas farms are now online. We
sold the first sustainable aviation fuel produced from our El Segundo refinery to Delta Air Lines at LAX. And
earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire Neste's Group III base oil business and its NEXBASE
brand. Pending regulatory approval, we anticipate closing in the first quarter of 2022. The acquisition is expected
to provide a capital-efficient approach to expand our base oil offerings and coupled with Novvi's renewable
products positions Chevron to be the supplier of choice to meet customers' needs now and into the future.
Back to you, Pierre.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thank, Mark. We recently released an updated climate change resilience report which includes a stress test of
the portfolio under IEA's net zero 2050 scenario; a new target called portfolio carbon intensity that includes Scope
1 and 2 and Scope 3 emissions from the use of our products; and Chevron's net zero 2050 aspiration for
upstream Scope 1 and 2 emissions. I encourage everyone to read our latest report available on our website.

Now, looking ahead, in the fourth quarter, we expect lower production due to a planned turnaround in Wheatstone
which was completed last week and repairs at the Alba Gas Plant in Equatorial Guinea. In addition, our
participation in the Rokan PSC in Indonesia ended in August. Production from Rokan averaged 84,000 barrels of
oil equivalent year-to-date.
We expect earnings from JKM-related spot sales out of Australia to increase around $50 million from third quarter
due to fewer spot cargoes as our long-term customers increase deliveries heading into winter. We're also
expecting three discrete cash items, a return of capital from Angola LNG, TCO's first dividend in several years
and a federal income tax cash refund. There are no P&L impacts from these items. During 4Q, we expect to buy
back shares at the high end of our guidance range.
Finally, we're lowering our full year C&E guidance to $12 billion to $13 billion primarily due to COVID-related
project spend deferrals into next year, lower non-op CapEx in the Permian and continued capital efficiencies.
To wrap up the quarter, we continued to make progress toward our objective of higher returns and lower carbon.
We're more capital and cost efficient, generated record free cash flow and are taking actions to lower the carbon
intensity of our operations and grow lower carbon businesses. We're executing a straightforward strategy that's
expected to deliver value now and well into the future.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Roderick.

question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get to all your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan
Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Devin McDermott
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Good morning. Congrats on the great results. So my first question, Pierre, I think is for you. I just wanted to ask
for a little bit more detail on the reduction in the capital spending guidance for this year. It sounds like it's a mix of
different factors. Some of it's deferrals to next year. Some of it's a mix of non-op and efficiency gains. Can you
just bridge the delta a little bit more detailed for us and also talk about whether or not these deferrals or how these
deferrals impact planned 2022 spend?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks, Devin. We lowered our CapEx guidance to $12 billion to $13 billion. That's from our budget of $14 billion
and from our revised guidance that we had in the second quarter of $13 billion. So in the last quarter, what's
changed? Well, we continue to see non-op spend in the Permian below our expectations. We did have some
deferred major capital project spending tied to Hurricane Ida and the Delta variant wave. And then we continue to
see continued capital efficiency in the Permian and across the portfolio. It does not change our CapEx guidance.
Our CapEx guidance for next year and through 2025 is $15 billion to $17 billion. We do expect higher CapEx in
the fourth quarter and next year. The low end of that range is about a 20% increase from the midpoint of our
revised guidance. So these deferrals are very manageable. And again, I would think from the original $14 billion
budget, about half you can think of deferrals and half I would say is capital efficiency and cost savings where
we're getting the same results for less capital.

Q

Got it. Makes a lot of sense. And my follow-up is on cash returns. So very strong free cash flow in the quarter.
Your debt target is now below the bottom end of your target range. It's good to see the increase in the cadence of
the buyback in 4Q. I guess my question is, what are some of the things you're looking for to further increase that
buyback target back to something closer to the pre-COVID run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

As you said, Devin, our guidance for fourth quarter is at the high end of the range. So that's a $3 billion annual
rate or $750 million in the quarter. And as I said last quarter and I'll restate now, we'll increase the buyback range
when Chevron's net debt ratio is comfortably below 20%. We ended third quarter with a net debt ratio a little bit
under 19%, down from 21% at the end of the second quarter. So we just got below 20%, but we're fast
approaching a net debt level where we could increase the buyback range further. As a reminder, Devin, I know
you know this. We intend to maintain our buyback for multiple years through the cycle. And so we're positioning
our balance sheet below our mid-cycle range so that'll enable us to continue buybacks even if the cycle turns.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Yeah. I just want to echo great results here. Pierre, I wanted to take a moment to talk about the global gas
market. You spent a lot of time looking at this over the years. How do you see it plan out from here? And there are
a lot of moving pieces as it relates to your gas portfolio, but one would be just any thoughts around spot cargoes.
And the other would be – it looked like you had some timing effects in the quarter that supported earnings. I would
think that would unwind later on. But just any modeling advice there? So a lot of moving pieces there, but your
thoughts on the gas portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks, Neil. First, I'd say that we are seeing high gas prices. It does feel more cyclical than structural. We've
seen demand very resilient through COVID on natural gas in particular. And supply has been impacted in part by
lower associated gas, just a slowdown in some supply activity. So, seeing demand and supply a little bit out of
sync is something that we've seen in the past and we expect that markets will work. We're seeing a commodity
price signal right now, and we expect markets to rebalance over time.
We have a very strong natural gas business. We have a nice position in North America, Australia, Eastern Med
through Noble Energy and in Africa. And so we're well positioned there. There's not much in the short term that
we can really do to increase supply. We have a position in the Haynesville and we could increase activity there.
But that'll have a modest impact on a company of our size. I think over the medium to longer term, we're working
expansion opportunities and particularly in the Eastern Med. And I think this is positive for signing up customers
and enabling kind of the next phase of expansion there. So, it's something that we're certainly well positioned for
and we're looking to expand supply into it.
In terms of the quarter, a couple of things, yeah, we did have a trading timing effect that was related to LNG. And
that's really tied to how we manage our overall portfolio pricing. So we have customer contracts that are oil-linked
and JKM-linked. And then we have various supplies and we try to match up the pricing. And in order to do that,
we essentially went along some JKM paper which clearly was mark-to-market positive in the quarter. Now that's
going to be matched against some physical deliveries in future quarters. So we call that timing because we expect
to see that unwind when those physical cargoes are delivered.
And then the last piece of guidance we had was really on fourth quarter earnings effects. We guided towards $50
million of increased earnings in 4Q versus 3Q from Australia LNG spot cargoes. And that's just to make the point
that we are going to have spot cargoes. We have all five trains operating. The Wheatstone planned turnaround is
complete. And we'll have actually more cargoes delivered in fourth quarter when you think of contract and spot.

But because it's heading into winter and many of our customers are in the Northern Hemisphere, their
nominations seasonally pick up heading into the winter. And so they will have higher takes under the long-term
contracts which are oil-linked, and that means we'll have fewer cargoes getting the higher JKM prices.
So, higher prices clearly in JKM, 4Q versus 3Q, fewer cargoes, that's a net benefit of about $50 million. We also
have some exposure out of our both Angola LNG and Equatorial Guinea. And so you can think about another $50
million or so from spot cargoes from those operations. So, sorry, it's a long answer to cover the full breadth of
natural gas this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta

Q

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

No, there's a lot of moving pieces. No, that's great. And then, Pierre, you're tracking really well on CapEx this
year. I think initially $14 billion, then $13 billion, now it looks like as low as $12 billion. Next year, if I remember,
CapEx is $15 billion to $17 billion is the range that you talked about. Is it fair to assume that the lower capital
spend this year would suggest that you'd be on the lower end of that range? And any moving pieces that we
should think about as you set up the 2022 spend level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

You'll see us increase capital in the fourth quarter just to get to that $12 billion to $13 billion, because we're at
$8.1 billion through the third quarter. Then you'll see that in the Permian; two more rigs, two more completion
crews. We'll have higher activity levels at Tengiz. We're going to maintain peak manpower through the winter.
And then activity tends to be back-end-loaded. So we have some project milestone payments. We have
exploration wells that we'll be drilling in the fourth quarter. So you'll see an increase in fourth quarter.
I think we'll announce our 2022 budget in December like we normally do. It'll be within the guidance. And I think
it's fair to say, it'll be towards the low end of the guidance. Again, even being at the bottom of the guidance of $15
billion of organic capital, that's at least a 20% increase off the midpoint of the guidance we just gave for this year.
So, again, I don't want to get ahead of that. But you should expect to see capital in the lower end of that guidance
range.

Q

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.

Pierre and Mark, thanks for taking my questions. Pierre, I hate to ask a housekeeping question, but you got to
help me out here a little bit on tax. The way I'm thinking about this is that there's been a lot of changes postNoble. Your mix has changed and obviously we've got a lot more profitability in the US with a low tax rate. So can
you help me – is what was going on with tax sustainable? Or was that a mix issue, or was there something
unusual going on? Because we saw your tax rate that low and I'm worried that we are carrying too high a tax rate
going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

The tax benefits in the third quarter, which we cited, are real. So this is a deferred tax asset. It was acquired
through Noble at the time of closing the transaction. We put a valuation allowance against it because these tax
attributes have a – they expire after a certain number of years. And based on projections of financial performance
at that time, we thought they would expire without us being able to use them.
Our financial performance is so much stronger that we actually were able to use them in the third quarter. So that
reduces our taxes both on an earnings and on a cash basis. So it's very real and it's an additional synergy from
Noble and it's not something that was included in our synergy estimates. That is not something that necessarily
will recur. We'll do a review of all of our tax attributes at year-end and see again what deferred tax assets could
have value going forward based on a change in conditions. But again, I would cite that that was in the All Other
segment. It's not something that you would expect to recur.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.

Q

All right. Got it. My follow-up is really on – I think it could be a balance sheet issue. But obviously, going back five
years ago, you guys [indiscernible] (00:19:48) a lot of projects going on back then. But when you think about the
cost of debt, which is obviously very, very low and we'll see if it stays there, versus the way you think about per
share dividend – so I'm trying to think – Exxon talks now about 20% to 25% as being the right level for them. It
seems like you're heading well below that kind of level. So what is the right level for you given that you can
obviously refinance at a very economic level and obviously step up the buybacks if you chose to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

When I became CFO, I answered this question that we didn't have a hard target on our net debt ratio. But 20% to
25% is a good place for us to be through the cycle. And there could be times where we'd go above it. For
example, when we showed our stress test – the only company in industry to show a stress test last year at $30

Brent for two years – to give confidence to our investors that we could maintain the dividend, our net debt ratio did
go above 25%. So that's appropriate.
We do not need to be anywhere close to where we were before with no net debt. But when prices are above midcycle, we should be below the low end of the range and we are. We got to less than 19% now. And we're fast
approaching a range where we could increase our buyback guidance. So it's very close to where we're at.
All of the excess cash that we'll be generating under these conditions – and we show that at $60, even prices well
below where we're at now that we can generate $25 billion of excess cash over five years. This is cash in excess
of our capital and our dividends. All that cash will be returned to shareholders over time in the form of a rising
dividend – and again, our dividend is up 12% since pre-COVID, the biggest increase in the sector – and a
buyback that's ratable and we maintain through the cycle.
We bought back shares 14 of the last 18 years. And so when we set a buyback rate, we intend to maintain it
through the cycle. That means we'll maintain it when the cycle turns and which means that we can in fact be doing
it off of debt for some time period. And we'll re-balance back into the range when we continue to buy back shares
if and when the cycle does turn down.

Jeanine Wai
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Good morning. We wanted to follow up on Devin's questions and I guess Doug's question as well, getting back to
the buyback. Pierre, you have already commented that you plan to maintain the buyback through multiple years
through the price cycles, which is great. I think we remember prior commentary that the goal is to not have to
reduce the buyback once it started.
So we wanted to just check in on that and how you think of the trajectory of any buyback increases. It sounds
more ratable versus opportunistic. We know there's a tremendous amount of free cash flow coming your way. But
also it seems like investor expectations are running alongside that versus being more ratable and that the strip is
backward-dated. So we just wanted to kind of check in on the trajectory.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Jeanine. If you look back to our history, we've never ended a buyback program at the rate that we
started. We tend to increase them. And I think you might be right that we haven't decreased them. Look, I'm not
opposed to that. We have a range. We're using the range. We're in the middle of the range in the third quarter
although it's the first quarter that we – since we've resumed buybacks we bought back shares in the first quarter
of last year pre-COVID. And now we're using the top of the range. And as I said, we're fast approaching a net
debt level where we can increase that guidance range further.
So no, our focus is on being ratable and maintain it through the cycle. Our investors, our shareholders have
different views on buybacks. Where we have the most common ground is do it consistently and do it through the
cycle when times are good and when times are tougher. And so we're setting the rate at a level that we have
confidence that we can maintain it through a commodity price cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeanine Wai

Q

Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Okay, great. Thank you for that. Our second question is really on the Permian and the outlook on capital
allocation. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing on inventory and supply-demand and maybe how
close are you to potentially accelerating in the Permian a little bit beyond of what you've already laid out? And I
guess on that, we know that it doesn't get much attention, but could you also be thinking about increasing activity
in other short cycle plays? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

We're going to increase capital in the fourth quarter and into next year. And so that'll be in the Permian and that'll
be in other locations. Again, as I said, even the bottom end of our guidance range, $15 billion, represents at least
a 20% increase from where we expect to end up this year. And we're seeing that in the fourth quarter. We'll see
two additional rigs in Permian, two additional completion crews. We're beginning to see a non-op pickup also.
Again, that's part of the reason why we lowered our guidance. Non-op has been a bit below our expectations. And
you can see it in other bases. We have a great portfolio with a number of short cycle investments.
But we're not changing our overall CapEx guidance range. Our CapEx guidance anticipated that we would be in a
recovery mode and it would increase over time. And we showed a five-year outlook on the Permian that shows
that we can grow production as an outcome of a very capital-efficient and also carbon-efficient development of
resource, that we can grow that production from 600,000 barrels a day to 1 million barrels a day. So we're
executing our plan. There's really no change in what we're doing. It's playing out the way we expected and seeing
a buildup in activity in the Permian and across other parts of our portfolio is what we had planned to do. And we're
going to do that in a very capital and cost-efficient way.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Q

Hey, Pierre. First question here just kind of circling around the capital allocation piece a little bit more. Back in
March, you talked about having $25 billion of excess cash or greater than $25 billion in excess cash over five
years at $60, implicitly suggesting the dividend would be covered around $50-ish Brent, I believe. I'm just curious
if, as you've progressed through this year, the performance that you've seen, et cetera, has anything changed
with that to make you think that that breakeven would be moving lower? Or is that still an area where you're
comfortable with?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

That's an area where we're comfortable with. It's just keeping oil prices constant. We're seeing Mark Nelson's
Downstream & Chemicals Group perform very well. We talked about natural gas pricing being strong both in
North America, Europe and International LNG. So those things aren't held constant. So if you looked at this
quarter's results, I think you'd see our breakeven would be a little bit lower. But in terms of mid-cycle assumptions
for refining margins, chemical margins, natural gas prices and then an oil breakeven, about $50 is certainly where
we're at.
Now, of course, that changes as our dividend goes up and other things over time because it's a dividend
breakeven. It's covering our capital and our dividend, but that math is still intact. We are a better company than
we were a few years ago. We showed that chart where our costs are lower, our production is higher and we're
much more capital efficient. We can sustain and grow this enterprise with less capital and that helps us deliver
higher returns and lower carbon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Philip M. Gresh

Q

Got it, okay. And then just a follow-up question on Wheatstone. There were some reports from your partners
about reserves being written down there. I just wanted to get your commentary. How do you think about this?
Does that mean something in terms of future capital requirements given that this is a longer cycle project? Just
any commentary you'd have there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

It's unrelated to Chevron. So if you recall, the Wheatstone Project was the first project in Australia and maybe the
world where there was third party – the reserves – the resources came from two different joint ventures. And so it
was Apache at the time and now it's Woodside. So it was really Woodside announcing that the fields that supply
their portion of that total through Wheatstone, that those reserves have a write-down. Chevron does not have an
interest in those reserves. So the Chevron fields that supply Wheatstone are not affected. And again, it's
unrelated to Chevron activity. It's only that we share the facility through them and those fields are also being
processed through.
Wheatstone is doing very well. We had a planned turnaround that covered a portion of third quarter and early into
fourth quarter. As I said, it was completed last week. And we expect to have all five of our Australia trains
operating this quarter. And as I said, we expect more cargoes. There's a lot of focus on JKM. But of course our
oil-linked contract prices will also be higher because they adjust with – oil prices are higher and then they adjust
with oil prices on a three- to six-month lag.

Q

Okay, thanks. Maybe a high-level question. You did your Energy Transition Spotlight event a little while back. You
said a share of the capital budget at close to – of low carbon businesses being close to 10% of the capital budget.
You've seen one of your peers here in the US raise theirs to a similar level.
As you think about the feedback that you received since then, our view was that it was a pragmatic balance
between allocation of capital towards good low-carbon businesses but not too much to kind of protect returns
dilution going forward. Is 10% of the budget – as you've seen the feedback over the last couple of months, do you
view that 10% of the budget is enough? Or do you think that's going to be something where you're going to see
increasing pressure to kind of creep that higher going forward?

I'll start and then I'll ask Mark to talk a little bit about some of our renewable fuels activities in his portfolio. We
have good shareholder support and alignment for our strategy and objectives of higher returns, lower carbon.
That's both lowering the carbon intensity of our traditional operations and then growing low-carbon businesses
that leverage our strengths, our capabilities, assets and customer relationships. And they target the sectors that
cannot be easily electrified, the hard-to-abate sectors. So this is things like air travel, industrial emissions, heavy
duty transport.
The $10 billion of capital is connected to some pretty ambitious targets that go up to 2030. So 150,000 tons per
annum of hydrogen, 25 million tons per year of carbon capture and storage. That's all consistent with that capital
guidance. So we are more in the execution mode and getting it done versus, let's say, competing on CapEx
targets. It's not easy to do. These are ambitious targets. They have challenges, lots of opportunity. But let me ask
Mark to talk a bit about his portion of that on renewable fuels.

Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

Thanks for the question, Ryan. I could use a real tangible example. You think about our El Segundo refinery and
our diesel hydrotreater conversion, we've said a few things are really important to us when it comes to renewable
diesel. We've said that the ability to sell it at the appropriate margin, the ability to have the right kind of feedstocks
and the ability to be capital efficient is critical for us to be successful.
And Southern California and the El Segundo refinery are an example of all of that. We've already increased our
sales – we're getting close to 40%, but let's say over 30% of renewable and biodiesel in Southern California. We
have our Bunge joint venture where we're working towards definitive agreements as we speak. And yet, they're
already supplying us at the El Segundo refinery.
And finally and perhaps most importantly, capital efficiency. We indicated in our Energy Transition Spotlight that
we expect to be a leader in the capital conversion of particular hydroprocessing units in our system. And we
believe we can do that for less than $1 per gallon of annual capacity and that's including any pre-treatment
requirements. So that gives us the ability to produce both renewable diesel and conventional diesel just with a
catalyst change if that's necessary.
So when you step back and you think about that work that's been done initially at El Segundo, where we did our
co-processing investment for very, very little money, we were able to test tanking and piping and metallurgy
needs. And now we're working towards a full conversion of that diesel hydrotreater here by the end of next year.
That won't be easy, but the team's working really hard on it, making very good progress. And that would be 100%
renewable diesel capacity and over 10,000 barrels a day. Thanks for the question, Ryan.

Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.

Okay. Thanks, Mark. Maybe a follow-up on some of your comments earlier, Pierre, where you mentioned – when
you were talking about gas markets and you mentioned the Eastern Med opportunities, we haven't talked about
that much in a little while. In your conversations with potential buyers of that gas in the basin, I mean, in the past
when it was operated by Noble, there was talk of everything between European targets to pipelines to Egypt to
floating LNG and all sorts of opportunities. Any thoughts on what may look like it makes the most sense there in
the Eastern Med and opportunities for whether it's shorter term de-bottlenecking and opportunities there versus
longer-term project development?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

All options are still on the table, Ryan. And it's commercially sensitive, so I don't want to show our hand in any
way. I mean, the point is that this is a great resource. There are some very low-cost expansions that can be done
and there are some larger expansions that can be done over time.
What's really changed is that was in a geography that a year ago looked oversupplied for natural gas and now it
looks much tighter. And so as you know, the natural gas business internationally is really dependent on getting
customers to sign up. And I think customers are more motivated now. And look, it's probably overdone. As I said
earlier, we expect the markets to correct. But it is a better time for us to be engaging.
So, it's a great resource, and in many cases, it's backing out of coal. It has expansion opportunities. It's been free
cash flow positive from the moment that we closed Noble. So it's just a great asset, and it's well positioned now to
have opportunities to grow in the future.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q

Hi, everyone. Pierre, if I could start with you, would it be possible to try and normalize your exposure to LNG given
that there are so many moving parts over the course of the past year or so? I'm just noting that you had said
during your comments that your spot exposure will be somewhat different in Q4 as a result of customers pulling
long-term contracts. If we could just take it apart a bit and sort of normalize into 2022-2023, where are your
volumes and how much of that is going to be long term versus spot, if you could have a go at that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Paul, we'll cover that more in our fourth quarter call when we give full-year guidance on a number of items. We
have a long-term contract that will begin next year. So it'll take our weighting to long-term contracts a little bit
higher. Again, we've been notionally around 80%. But that's why we very consciously just provided guidance for
this quarter, as it will change a little bit next year. But we'll do that on the fourth quarter call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey
Analyst, Sankey Research

Q

Okay, I'll move on to Mark. But if I could just slip a quick one in for you, in regards to modeling, do I assume that
we put everything into buyback in terms of free cash flow, or are there any other items that you would highlight,
maybe pension or something, that we should just be aware of going into 2022? And how much should we
consider your buyback to be? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Over time, the vast majority of the excess cash will be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividends
and the buyback. We did a one-time pension supplement last quarter. It was really tied to the very low interest
rates from a year ago. It sounds like a long time ago. But under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation rules,
the funding requirement is fixed on the year-end interest rates. And so we were a little bit underfunded and
therefore would have paid a little higher what's called a variable interest rate essentially, higher than our costs of
borrowing. And so that's why we supplemented it.
Obviously, we're in a much different place in terms of interest rates now, and you'd expect our pension
contributions to be as they have been. And we provide guidance on pension in our 10-Q filing. So, I would not
expect anything on that end. So again, if you go to our financial priorities, Paul, you know them well, sustain and
grow the dividend. It's up 12% since pre-COVID, the biggest increase in the sector. Our capital guidance is going
to be up, but it's no change from the guidance range. And it's in the very tight guidance range and very capitalefficient and lower where it was pre-COVID. We're going to pay down a little more debt.
As I said, we're fast approaching a level where we can increase our buyback range. And so then the balance is
excess cash, and over time, it goes to shareholders. We're not going to sweep it out each quarter because
investors are very clear that they want us to maintain a buyback through the cycle.

I think it's time for you to ask a question to Mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey
Analyst, Sankey Research

Q

Well, thanks, Pierre. Mark, a very general question, but could you talk about how capacity is changing
downstream both in refining and in chemicals? Because I know we're adding a lot of chemicals, obviously. We're
also shutting down a lot of downstream. Firstly, is there any way that Chevron is dramatically changing its
capacity and exposure downstream? And secondly, could you talk about that in the context of where you see US
and global capacity? I know this could take two hours, I apologize, but if you could generally say how global
capacity has shifted and the more numbers you could give us, the better. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. Thanks, Paul. So let's start with the refining side of the business and use margin as the proxy for capacity
being utilized. We've said demand has to recover for high-value products. Inventory has to fall into traditional
ranges. And then we need some degree of refinery rationalization, either closures or conversions throughout the
system.
If you're in the US today, I think you're seeing much of that demand recovery with jet still to come. And that's even
with the offices not completely open and still some restrictions in place, inventory tending to find itself in traditional
boundaries, and starting to see some closures and/or conversions in some of our markets, especially the US
West Coast, which means the market could actually be tight on things like motor gasoline and even jet five or six
years from now. So you see that in the United States.
If I shift to Asia, I would say that demand recovery on jet is a little bit behind that of the US, especially given our
exposure to Southeast Asia. Inventory reduction falling into those ranges is starting to happen, some of that with
China stopping some of its exports for the moment. But demand catching up with refinery capacity in Asia still
needs to happen. And that means that we both need perhaps some rationalization, as well as demand just to
catch up with the capacity that's there. And so, my high level comment would be that in the United States, we're
seeing the actions to bring refinery margins into balance over time, getting closer to historic ranges. And just a
half phase behind that maybe in Asia.
Then for the petchem side of the equation. Petchem margins have had a strong run this year on the back of good
demand and considerable supply disruptions. We would expect to see margins come off as we get to the fourth
quarter, normal seasonal type of dropoff. But we're actually preparing for it with capacity growth over the next few
years. We expect that to outpace demand. So we're at that part of the cycle. And even in 2025, we're presuming
we'll be on the lower portion of the margin cycle. So that means that there'll be a period of catch-up there in
regard to demand catching capacity. Hopefully, I got to your [indiscernible] (00:41:31).

Paul Sankey

Q

You did. Thanks, Mark. And just from a Chevron point of view, is there any major changes in your capacity over
the next five years that you anticipate in refining and chemicals? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A

Other than the comments we've made about – you remember it was about a decade ago that we did much of our
what I'll call rationalization, meaning taking things out of our portfolio. And we've highlighted in our Energy
Transition Spotlight that we have this opportunity for this very capital-efficient conversion of individual
hydroprocessing units. And we will certainly do that over the next decade to get to that 100,000 barrels a day of
[ph] our DSAF (00:42:04) capacity.

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

Hey. Thank you and good morning. Pierre, I'm going to hit you on capital returns, buybacks, and balance sheet.
No, I'm just kidding. Mark, I would like to ask you about the Group oil base III acquisition, kind of how that fits in
the overall structure and what we should think about there. And whether or not – we've seen some stories about
renewable feedstock for Group III, maybe how you see that working in over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. Thanks, Roger. As mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're excited about the announced acquisition of
Neste's Group III base oil business and the NEXBASE brand. And the reason for that is it's a very capital-efficient
acquisition of both offtake of supply, appropriate qualifications, and the NEXBASE brand itself. And what that
does for us is it allows us to expand our offerings. So we're going to add that to our existing Group II, II+, and
Novvi offering to have a complete offering for the base oil needs for our customers in the future.
And think about that Novvi brand that we've talked about. I think in the Energy Transition Spotlight, we shared that
Walmart would be selling online our Havoline PRO-RS, the first renewable lubricant line. And we've actually
brought some of that forward. And starting next Monday, we will have our installer base in North America,
specifically the United States and Canada in particular, running a whole line of Havoline PRO-RS. So we're
creating that demand for the renewable portion of that offering. And it really gives us something where we can be
that supplier of the future for our base oil customers. Thanks for the question, Roger.

Roger D. Read

Q

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Yeah, absolutely. And then if we could come back to some of the things on the CapEx. You referenced delays out
of the Gulf of Mexico due to the storms, which totally makes sense. As you look at the development and some of
the exploration I think you're looking to do out there over the next couple of years, is there any change to that or
any sort of change in the order of projects we should pay attention to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

No. We have a steady stream of projects, really, with Anchor that has been underway, Whale that recently went to
a final investment decision and Ballymore which is coming along. So you'll see a very ratable development
program. Gulf of Mexico is a high return, low carbon asset, some of the lowest carbon intensity barrels in our
portfolio in the single digits and is a business that we've been invested in for decades, have knowhow and some
competitive advantages and can find attractive investment opportunities. So it's sort of a modestly growing part of
the portfolio.
If you think of the biggest growth that we have going forward, it clearly is in the Permian which I referred to earlier.
Tengiz, a project that we're investing in and the project is going very well. And the project will come on in a couple
of years. But when you get to Gulf of Mexico, the Rockies or Colorado, a few other places also have very
attractive investment opportunities that can deliver both higher returns and lower carbon.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Biraj Borkhataria
Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.

Q

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions. The first one was just thinking about the balance sheet.
Because of your conservatism and the way you've managed your balance sheet, you've been able to make some
countercyclical moves and Noble was obviously the most recent one. Given we're at the high point of the cycle
now, can you talk about any plans to accelerate asset sales? I know it's not needed for the balance sheet. But I
was interested to hear whether you think there are any opportunities out there. And if so, are they across
Upstream, Downstream or Chemicals?
And the second question is on Tengiz. It's good to see the dividend come through after a number of years. Are
there any loan repayments due in 2022? And then, finally, just a quick comment to say thanks for the PCI
calculation tool which you published. It's actually quite difficult to dig into some of those figures and understand all
of the variances. So I appreciate the transparency there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, thank you, Biraj, for recognizing PCI. Our teams will be very happy to hear that. We wanted to make a tool
that was transparent where you could use it for other companies because I know comparability is of interest to
investors. And so it's based on, again, transparent reporting data and comparability. And so thank you for taking
advantage of that and I encourage others to check it out.
Let me just talk about TCO because as we look back, we had a very successful spring and summer campaign
there. We hit our productivity targets and we achieved a lot of our milestones. And we had a full workforce. So we
had a Delta variant wave which caused some higher levels of isolation in the middle of the third quarter. But we
ended the quarter with positive rates very, very low. And we're back to our full workforce. And as I mentioned
earlier, we intend to maintain a peak manpower workforce level through the winter months.
We have a vaccination rate over 85% for that workforce. So we're well-positioned to make a lot of progress this
winter. Now we have to be thoughtful about it because it can get cold there. So we're sequencing the work in a
way that we're saving work that could be done indoors or in sheltered locations during the coldest months of the
winter. So no change, clearly, in the guidance that we provided on second quarter in terms of budget and
schedule. But I wanted to give an update. Things are going very well in Tengiz and we're looking forward to a very
productive winter season there.
In terms of the dividend, you're right. It's the first dividend in three years, so that's nice to see. We did have a
modest loan repay back that occurred last quarter. And look, we'll give guidance on 2022, just like with Paul's
question, when we look forward. It'll depend clearly also on oil prices. But that's something that we'll give
guidance on on our 4Q call. In terms of asset sales, yes, we acquired Noble or announced the acquisition when
Brent was in the low $40s. And now Brent is in the low $80s. And so it's a commodity business. It has cycles, ups
and downs. And when you buy or sell assets, timing makes a difference, where you are in the cycle. And of
course, strategic fit and all of the elements.
We're very, very pleased with the Noble transaction. We talked about the timing of it, the first to do it, the
synergies that were doubled and the tax benefits that we saw this quarter and interest cost savings. So we did
tender a number of bond offerings earlier this month. A lot of those bonds were Noble bonds. Again, that was not
included in our synergies because we weren't quite sure we could achieve that. And we'll save over $100 million
in interest cost savings. So Noble just keeps contributing to the company. And that's part of the reason why we're
a better company now than we were several years ago.
But it's a different market. So yeah, I view it more as a seller's market than a buyer's market right now. And so
you're seeing us modestly increase some assets that don't compete for capital as well in our portfolio. In fact, one
of them is our position in the Eagle Ford. So that was a Noble legacy position. Chevron legacy was not in it. So
we don't have quite the scale that we would like. But again, essentially, buying that position at $40 and now we
have it on the market. That's in the public domain. And obviously, we expect to get much higher value than for
what was implied in the purchase price. We have some other US onshore assets that are on the market again
that we feel are very attractive to a lot of industry players but just won't compete for capital as well in our portfolio.
Thanks, Biraj.

Good morning.

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.

Q

So the first one is for Mark. Mark, you guys did the Pasadena refinery. And at the time, you said that is one-off
because [indiscernible] (00:50:47) your Pascagoula refinery. There's quite a lot refinery that's available for sale in
here. So I wanted to see with the substantial amount of the refining capacity being shut, does it change the way
that – how you're looking at that business or that you think you already have sufficient of the capacity and
supplementary and you really don't need to add? And also, in the retail marketing, some of your peers that have
been aggressively building that up and including in the US. And you guys have – out of that business for more
than 10 years. And is there any plan to going back so that – on the energy transition including in the EV charger
and all that?
The second question is for Pierre. You talk about, say, the TCO dividends. How about the Angola LNG? Can you
give us some idea that, if the current commodity price holds, should we assume every year that both Angola LNG
and the TCO is going to pay the dividend? And any cost sensitivity you can provide that if the change in the oil
price, how that impacts on that dividend payout going to look like.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

All right, Paul. Thank you for the questions. I'll take them I guess in reverse order. I think your second question
was really about retail marketing. And as you know, we have three world-class brands. And we've taken a capital light approach to selling our branded fuels. In fact, one of the metrics that we often look at is the OPIS brand
power rating. And we continue to be well at the top of that list. And what that means is the majority of our retail
sites around the world that you would see are owned by retailers who have specifically chosen our brand. And so
we have our brand, our fuel and generally not our capital.
We also happen to have one of the strongest retail convenience franchising offerings out there, ExtraMile, that
you've probably seen. In fact, I think we hit our 1,000th site this year with very, very little attrition. And so, we
believe that our limited capital approach provides us the majority of the margin and sustainably delivers high
returns and still allows us to stay connected with customers. And as part of that offering to customers, today we
have EV charging stations in seven countries around the world. And we're partnering with our retailers to continue
to expand that offering as customers actually need it.
Your second question was, I think, about the refinery portfolio in general and maybe Pasadena specifically. We're
very pleased with our refining portfolio to date. And it's really because of that hydro-processing capacity that we
have across our system. It gives us flexibility to deal with the fuels of the future and renewable fuels in particular
in a very, very capital-efficient way.
Specific to Pasadena, again, we have an opportunity there. The premise of the acquisition continues to hold for us
in processing our equity crude, being able to supply our own service stations in the Texas-Louisiana area, and
then of course, having the intermediates back and forth between Pascagoula and Pasadena. That's all working as
we would expect. And we've shared that we think there's an opportunity there to have very efficient expansion of
light tight oil processing capacity. And we've hinted that that's going to be a hydroskimming focus. We're working
on that real hard and look forward to talking more about that next year. Thanks for your question, Paul. Pierre?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. And on Angola LNG, so in our looking ahead slide, Paul, we guide towards $300 million of return of capital.
It's essentially a dividend. It's just kind of an accounting characterization of it as return of capital. It's cash is the
bottom line. And in terms of guidance going forward, I would just say Angola LNG does sell into the spot market
essentially both on oil-linked strips and into Europe TTF or international JKM markets.
So it does have exposure to international natural gas pricing. $300 million will be a nice return of capital here in
the fourth quarter. And again, just like with Paul Sankey's question, we'll provide guidance for our full LNG
portfolio on the fourth quarter call for 2022. That'll include Australia, Angola LNG, and our interest in Equatorial
Guinea, which again is another asset that was acquired through Noble Energy. Thanks, Paul.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Manav Gupta
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC

Q

Hey, guys. Two questions, I'll ask them upfront. The first one is I'd like to pick your brain on the mid-cycle
chemical margins here. Historically, we thought the mid-cycle would be more like $0.25. Obviously, right now, we
are more like $0.65. And even though you did say the margins will decline, some of the bigger chemical ethylene
players are out there saying we will settle for the next two, three years above the mid-cycle level. So, while the
mid-cycle could be $0.25, you could still see $0.35 to $0.40. So that's the first question.
And the second question is we're seeing you get into the CNG distribution for the first time. And I'm wondering if
this is associated with your strategy of developing RNG and basically controlling the entire value chain so you can
distribute your RNG that you're going to produce through your distribution network.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark A. Nelson

A

Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Manav. Got your questions. So first on petrochemical margins, we indicated as we look to the longest of
terms, we expect petchem demand to continue to grow in line with long-term GDP growth. We believe in kind of
the next four to five years, we do see capacity growth in the next couple of years going past demand, which
brings us towards the bottom portion of the margin cycle.
And so, I think we shared in our Investor Day discussions last year that we brought our view down. And it's, again,
erring on the side of conservative perhaps, but that it was going to be $0.20 per pound in regard to where we
could expect those margins over time. And anything above that, of course, we will take. And it drives us in our
CPChem joint venture to make sure that we continue to work on our unit cost reductions, which they have done a
very good job on and will continue to do going forward. And so, we see that as our number looking forward.
And then when I get to your comment on the RNG portfolio, you read it exactly correctly. Our close on the 60
American Natural Gas sites is really about us leveraging our strengths. When we talk about renewable natural
gas, we say a couple things. We say it leverages our strengths, and bio feedstocks are really important. The
strengths in particular are value chain activation and partnerships. And the two areas where you can see this at
play actually in the formal presentation would be in the gas that's now coming from CalBio from all of the farms
that we have there, and then our Brightmark activity experiencing their first delivered gas.
On the 60 CNG sites, the American Natural Gas CNG sites with Mercuria, that allows us to follow the request of
our customers, if you will. We're trying to get CNG to those customers throughout our portfolio, and that's the first
step in doing it and a platform for us to grow.

Q

Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in. I may have missed it, but can you just discuss the drivers of why TCO is
declaring this dividend now, and kind of what we should look to to assess if they'll declare it next year and just
some background on how we could calculate that. And then my second question, just on cost inflation, what
you're seeing across your projects, if it's impacting TCO at all or any of your either long-cycle projects or shortcycle in the Permian. Thanks.

Thanks, Jason. Yeah, I should have mentioned. No, TCO is paying a dividend, and it was in the plan. But it could
be higher than was planned, which is why we've guided to a range, primarily because two things, one, clearly the
macro environment is stronger, so it produces a light oil that attracts trades to a tight discount to Brent. And with
the fiscal terms and the rest of it, it's generating excess cash. And also we've seen at the project some real cost
savings. Again, we've seen some deferrals, but that would be factored into retaining cash in TCO. But we've seen
some underlying greater efficiencies, and we've seen some foreign exchange benefits there. So, it's a function of
things going well both from a market environment and from an execution of the project.
Again, in terms of 2022, we will provide guidance on the fourth quarter call like we have in prior years. We've
guided historically to that cash flow line, which is the difference between dividends and affiliate earnings. I think
we also might just give separately a range on expected dividends from Tengiz and other major affiliates. And then
in terms of cost, we're not really seeing cost increases. US onshore rigs are maybe creeping up, but they're still
well below where they were pre-COVID. And in general, the industry is operating below capacity. So although
there are pockets of goods and services that we use that are tied to the general economy like steel and clearly
steel is up, but the majority of our costs are tied to industry-specific major equipment. And that's still operating
below capacity. So it could increase in the future. I know there's a lot of talk about it. But what we're seeing up to
date is costs are well under control.
