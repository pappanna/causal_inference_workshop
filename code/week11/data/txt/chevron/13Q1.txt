Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a
question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder,
this conference call is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation,
Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call
and webcast. On the call with me today is Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We'll refer to the
slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on slide 2.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's first quarter earnings were $6.2 billion
or $3.18 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 18%. Our debt ratio at the
end of March was approximately 9%. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the second
quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount.
Turning to slide 4, this week, Chevron's Board of Directors declared a $1.00-per-share quarterly common stock
dividend, payable in mid-June. This is an 11% increase and reflects the performance and strength of our current
portfolio and our confidence in our compelling growth prospects. Since 2004, our dividend has grown at a
compound annual rate of 11%, a growth rate that is well in excess of the S&P 500 and better than our peers. You
can see this on the left chart. This pattern demonstrates the priority we place on rewarding our investors through
increasing distribution.
The chart on the right provides updated information on five-year rolling total return to shareholders through the
end of the first quarter. Our strong financial and operational performance and superior growth prospects for both
production and value are being recognized by the market. We have led on this rolling total shareholder return for
an extended period of time now, and we are off to a strong start in 2013.
Turning to slide 5, cash generated from operations was $5.7 billion during the first quarter, a lower level than it
has been in some time. This is primarily the result of working capital impacts. Overall, working capital
requirements for the company increased by $3.4 billion in the quarter. This working capital consumption of cash
was principally in our Downstream operations. This is not an atypical pattern for us for the first quarter of the
year, though this quarter's increase in working capital requirements is larger than we have usually seen.
The increase reflects the timing and pricing of commodity purchases and sales between quarters as well as the
operational downtime we had at several refineries this quarter. The vast majority of these effects are temporary in
nature and the impacts to cash flow are expected to reverse in future quarters. Importantly, our upstream
business continues to generate strong cash flows.

Capital and exploratory expenditures were $8.2 billion during the quarter including expenditures associated with
our buy-in to the Kitimat LNG project. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and at quarter end cash
balances exceeded $19 billion giving us a net cash position of almost $5 billion.
Jeff will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Pat.
Turning to slide 6, I'll compare results of the first quarter 2013 with the fourth quarter 2012. As a reminder, our
earnings release compares first quarter 2013 with the same quarter a year ago.
First quarter earnings were $6.2 billion, about $1 billion lower than fourth quarter results. Upstream earnings
were down $942 million reflecting the absence of fourth quarter asset transaction gains partly offset by higher
realizations and a favorable swing in foreign currency effects.
Downstream results decreased $224 million between quarters driven by lower volumes largely associated with
seasonal maintenance activity and the absence of fourth quarter asset transactions partly offset by a positive swing
in foreign currency effects. The variance in the Other bar largely reflects lower corporate charges.
On slide 7, our U.S. upstream earnings for the first quarter were $231 million lower than fourth quarter's results.
Higher realizations improved earnings by $95 million driven largely by an increase in crude oil prices. Lower
production volumes decreased earnings by $80 million mainly due to increased maintenance activity in the Gulf
of Mexico and fewer producing days in the quarter. The net of higher DD&A and lower operating expenses
reduced earnings by $85 million. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including the absence of
favorable tax effects and gains on small asset transactions in the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide 8, international upstream earnings were $711 million lower than the fourth quarter. Earnings
increased approximately $130 million due to higher realizations partly offset by lower liftings. A favorable swing
in foreign currency effects improved earnings by about $200 million. The first quarter had a gain of $170 million
compared to a loss of $30 million in the fourth quarter. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by about
$200 million between periods primarily due to reduced maintenance activities and employee costs.
The Other bar reflects a number of items including favorable tax affects in addition to lower exploration expenses.
Finally, earnings decreased by about $1.5 billion between quarters primarily due to the absence of the gain on the
Browse asset exchange recognized during the fourth quarter.
Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production
decreased 23,000 barrels per day between quarters. Lower cost recoveries on production sharing contracts spread
across multiple countries reduced production by about 16,000 barrels per day. This is an investment timing issue
which we noted in our interim update. The base business and Other bar includes the impact of planned
turnaround activity, weather disruptions and normal field declines. Contributions from major capital projects
increased first quarter production by 9,000 barrels per day primarily driven by Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico and
Platong II in Thailand.

Turning to slide 10, U.S. downstream earnings fell $196 million between periods. Lower volumes reduced
earnings by $190 million primarily due to planned maintenance at the Pascagoula, Mississippi and El Segundo,
California refineries. First quarter 2013 was a particularly heavy refinery maintenance period for the company.
Maintenance at both Pascagoula and El Segundo has now been successfully completed.
We also reintroduced feed stock to our Richmond refinery crude unit earlier this week and will continue bringing
the downstream conversion units to full capacity over the coming days. Weaker margins decreased earnings by
$65 million. Seasonally weak demand, particularly for gasoline, combined with rising crude costs, pressured
refining and marketing margins. The Other bar reflects several miscellaneous items including lower operating
expenses, higher chemical earnings, and the absence of year-end LIFO inventory draw down benefits that were
recognized last quarter.
On slide 11, international downstream earnings were $28 million lower this quarter. Lower volumes reduced
earnings by $75 million, primarily due to planned maintenance at the Burnaby, Canada, and Cape Town, South
Africa refineries. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $95 million, reflecting lower transportation and
environmental expenses.
Foreign currency effects represented a $175 million positive earnings variance between quarters. First quarter's
FX gain was about $75 million compared to a fourth-quarter loss of $100 million. Gains on asset transactions
were $135 million lower, reflecting the absence of prior quarter asset sales. The Other bar again reflects a number
of unrelated items, including lower shipping results, weaker lubricants margins, and higher withholding and other
tax-related charges.
Slide 12 covers All Other. This segment broadly consists of corporate administrative functions, our worldwide cash
management and financing activities, as well as our Mining, Power Generation, Real Estate, and Energy
Technology and Services businesses. First quarter net charges were $439 million compared to $538 million in the
fourth quarter, a decrease of $99 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate charges resulted in a
$111 million benefit to earnings, while corporate tax items were $12 million higher this quarter.
With that, I'd now like to turn it back to Pat.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay. Now turning to slide 13, last month we held our annual Security Analyst Meeting where we provided
updates on our projects and future growth plans as well as our financial performance relative to our key
competitors. We now have fully updated relative performance data in a couple of areas, segment returns on capital
employed and upstream cash margins.
First, our upstream adjusted return on capital employed was 21.5% for 2012, and we can confirm this placed us in
the number one position relative to our major peers for the second year in a row. We completed the restructuring
of our Downstream business, and our adjusted return on capital employed in 2012 improved again to over 18%.
Here we rank a strong number two against our peers, and we've been closing the gap versus the leader for each of
the last five years.
Slide 14 shows our updated upstream cash margin comparison. We have led the peer group in upstream
realizations for several years, a trend which continued in 2012. Combined with our competitive cost structure and
the quality of our portfolio, we also continued to lead the peer group on unit cash margins. In fact, our cash
margin of just under $37 per barrel exceeded the average cash margin from our peer group by $11 per barrel or
over 40%. This superior performance is a function of the quality of our assets as well as our strong execution
capabilities.
Turning to slide 15, I'd like to share some highlights of the strategic progress we've made during the quarter. We
announced successful well test results at St. Malo in the U.S. deepwater Gulf of Mexico where oil flow rates, while
limited by testing equipment constraints, exceeded 13,000 barrels per day. With new technology, we saw drilling
efficiencies and good reservoir stimulation, and this bodes well for improving the recoveries and the economics on
our existing and future Gulf of Mexico projects. The Big Foot hull has arrived in the Gulf of Mexico, and the
Jack/St. Malo hull is on its way. The picture is of the Jack hull being transported.
We announced the signing of a binding long-term sales and purchase agreement with Chubu Electric to deliver 1
million tons per year of LNG from the Wheatstone project. Our Wheatstone LNG project has over 80% of its off
take secured under long-term sales contracts.
In the downstream, a new gas well cracker achieved startup, making the Yeosu Refinery in South Korea the largest
processor of heavy oil in that country. We continue to be successful with our exploration program, with new
discoveries at Coronado in the U.S. deepwater Gulf of Mexico and in Australia's Carnarvon Basin, where we
announced discoveries at Kentish Knock South and the Elfin-1 Prospect. The Elfin-1 prospect is our 21st discovery
since 2009.
We added new offshore exploration acreage in both Morocco and China. We also reached an agreement to enter
the Cooper Basin in Australia, another early, low cost entry opportunity focused on unconventional resources.
Finally, we recently sanction the Moho Nord development located in the Republic of Congo, the largest ever oil
and gas development in that country.
I'd like to close by saying we're off to a great start in 2013. Earnings are strong, upstream activity is on plan not
only in terms of production but also in terms of executing well against our major development project milestones.
I encourage you to visit our investor website where we recently posted updated photos of our progress on our
Gorgon and Wheatstone projects.
We also continue to pursue future possible growth opportunities which will create additional value for our
shareholders over time. Our healthy dividend growth pattern remains in place. This marks our 101st year of
paying dividends and our 26th consecutive year of growing our annual dividend distribution. We continue to
provide the strongest returns to shareholders offering a good balance between share price appreciation and
dividend yield.
We truly appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company. I'd like to now open up the
microphones for questions. We do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and a single followup if necessary. We'll certainly do our best to see that we get all of your questions answered.
Sean, please open up the lines for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please go
ahead with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Edward G. Westlake
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Q

Hey. Good morning, Pat. Just a quick question on the tax rate if I may. Obviously it dropped down to 39.3% and
you flag favorable tax rates in some of the commentary. Are there any structural changes here in terms of shifts or
is this just a tax optimization in the quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

There's nothing structural here, Ed. As you probably know that as certain projects mature and particularly as they
get to the FID stage it's not unusual to have certain tax impacts triggered by reaching that project milestone and
that's really what we saw occurring here in the first quarter. That's what gave us a low effective tax rate in first
quarter 2013. We expect this to balance out over the end of the year. And so I think from a longer term
perspective, thinking back to the 2012 effective tax rate which was about 43%, that's a pretty reasonable place for
you to peg the overall expectation for the year.

Q

Thanks. That's very helpful. Switching topics on natural gas in the U.S. obviously a bit of benefit from Marcellus
and Atlas over the last couple of quarters but the gas price I guess it's rebounded a little bit. Should we expect that
gas production probably trends down a little bit as it started to in the first quarter as you go to through the balance
of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, I think what we have said in the past that we have really restricted all of our dry gas production to minimal
amounts, principally in the Marcellus area. And of course we're being helped there economically by the carry that
is still in place. All the rest of our gas production efforts really are geared towards heavy liquids concentration
efforts. So we should continue to see those ramp up.

Q

Let me ask a longer-term question of how you think about the longer-term CapEx and cash-return strategy. I ask
in the context of, in my view, Chevron's relative free cash flow influx in 2014/2015 time period and as you begin to
see the cash benefit of these relatively, heavier and current period of capital investment and the question hence
becomes, do you believe that when you likely have incremental cash during this period that cash returns to
shareholders via buybacks or dividends increase or that you see additional reinvestment opportunities in the
portfolio to maybe replicate this 2014 to 2017 growth period? How do you think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. Well, I would say broadly I mean first of all, we believe the best way over time that we create value for our
shareholders is by making the right investment choices. If we have a strong queue, if we have projects that are very
nicely attractive, nicely economic, then obviously that's an important element for us. We have been in a stage
where we have had very nicely attractive projects. And so that is really what has given rise to the heavy investment
period of time.
We do take our dividend commitment to our shareholders very, very seriously. That is the first priority of return of
distribution to the shareholders. So you should expect that to continue to grow as long as earnings and cash flows
continue to grow. And we of course are able to grow earnings and cash flows if we invest appropriately. So we
work very hard at trying to get that balance right between attractive projects for reinvestment in the business and
then also dividend distributions to the shareholders.
If we get into periods of time where we have surplus cash, free cash flow beyond the C&E requirement, beyond the
dividend requirement, that's really what we peg our share-repurchase program to distribute. And we look at that
every quarter. We evaluate what we think kind of the medium-term requirements for the firm are in terms of
reinvestment. We obviously have a hypothesis about what our board might do on dividends. We look at what we
think is happening from a commodity-price standpoint and therefore what net generation into the firm might be.
And that's how we peg our share repurchases. It is the most flexible element of our cash distribution formula.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

And then understood. Let me try maybe one different way if I could. I mean, you know, like, the percentage of
CAPM that's invested in the project queue that's not adding to [indiscernible] (20:25) today is relatively higher
than where it's been historically. I think you hit the 35% number at the analyst day. And I know there's a lot of
variabilities. But under current conditions would you expect that to normalize back into this 25% to 30% range
once you are exiting this kind of peak spending period through we'll call it the 2015 timeframe? I'll leave it at that.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. And I think the best guidance I can give you on that would be to have you take a look at the duration of the
investment cycles for some of the projects that we have underway. When you are talking about LNG projects – and
of course we've got Gorgon and Wheatstone underway. We have Kitimat, which is in the very, very embryonic
stage here. But those have very long investment cycles, 60 months plus. That's much different than what you
would get in sort of the factory investment types of cycles that you might achieve in say a Permian ramp up, for
example.
So I think you need to look at the kinds of projects that we have in our queue and the overall investment-cycle
time for those projects in the queue. And that is going to give you an indication of how much pre-productive
capital we might have built up on our balance sheet at any point in time. I did say back in March that our preproductive capital was in the high 30s. And that is an abnormally high level for us. And so all things being equal,
once you get through the heavy spend period, we would expect that to come down as long as we don't have
another set of projects moving forward. We do try to balance this all out. And in the end I think we have certainly
demonstrated a history of doing that, being able to do that successfully. Because our project queue has been – is
very economic and it's producing the returns that we're benefiting from, from a cash flow standpoint and our
investors are benefiting from, from a distribution standpoint.

Operator: Your next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Arjun Narayana Murti
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.

Q

Thank you. A question on the Cooper Basin. When we were in Perth last fall sometime, Chevron did not sound
particularly excited about some of the East Coast LNG opportunities and stuff over in Queensland. Just curious
whether this Cooper Basin entry signals any change to that view? Maybe I misread it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

You know, Arjun, I would not read too much into it. I think we were talking very broadly back in the fall. And as a
general rule as a company we are always on the lookout for what I would consider low-cost, early-entry
opportunities. And that's really what the Cooper Basin represents. It's a very new play. I can't really indicate how
that may in fact turn out for us. We just think it was an opportunity to expand our unconventional portfolio, and
there's an awful lot of work that will need to be done to evaluate the basin. But we're hopeful that something could
turn out there. I think you need to think of it as low-cost entry and very early in the evaluation phase.

Q

Got it. That's helpful, Pat. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. Any update on the timing of Angola LNG
startup and Frade startup? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. So on Angola LNG, our expectation is that we will have first LNG here in the second quarter. Assuming that
happens, then we would expect then to get to full capacity by year end. And again, assuming that things move as
we think they will, it's probably going to add to us about 20,000 barrels a day for the full year. Obviously that
would just be a partial-year contribution for us. It's worth about 60,000 barrels a day net to us when fully
operational.
From a Frade standpoint, we have received approval for a production restart for four wells basically, no injection
activity. And that should be here in the second quarter as well but it will be ramping up relatively slowly, and so
the contribution for the year will be relatively modest, only about 5,000 barrels a day.

Good morning, Paul.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul B. Sankey
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

Good morning. Just a quick one. Was there some tax changes in Kazakhstan as it relates to exports, is the first
one?
And the bigger one which you may be able to answer or not is, can you talk a little bit about the sensitivity of your
CapEx levels to the dollar, to appreciation in the dollar? I assume that an appreciating dollar would bring down
your global CapEx. I wondered if you have a sense for sensitivities. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Right. So the first answer is no, the tax change didn't relate to Kazakhstan.
And versus the – in terms of our capital program, we're really most sensitive to movements from a capital
program standpoint to the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. And I think we've explained in the past that,
yes, it's been a component. We have had higher foreign exchange impacts that was part of the Gorgon cost
increase up to $52 billion, about a third of that increase from the original FID number. It was related to foreign
exchange effects, so that has impacted us there.
This year it has really been much more modest than that. And as we've said in the past, we haven't hedged against
the Australian dollar or hedged the Gorgon or Wheatstone activities because usually the Australian dollar is
moving with commodity prices, and usually that means that we've got a natural hedge.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Paul B. Sankey
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Yeah, I was just kind of wondering because I guess if the dollar strengthens globally, it would tend to imply that
the oil price will come down. But clearly what you're saying is, the main sensitivity by far is the Aussie dollar.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

That's exactly right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Paul B. Sankey

And not, not – for example, the euro wouldn't make a whole lot of difference either way, yeah?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Not from a C&E standpoint, no.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul B. Sankey
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

I thought I had read – by the way, going back to first question, that Kazakhstan had changed its export tariffs. Was
I just wrong?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

A

No, Paul. This is Jeff. That's correct. They did increase the export tax, but our assets are not affected by the
increase. Our netbacks are not impacted.

Hello, Doug.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Hi, Pat. We're looking forward a couple years to some very substantial step-ups in production, but we don't really
hear you talk much about portfolio high grading. Is that something that – is this really, you're very happy with the
asset base you have now, or is it an ongoing effort to pare, if you like, the bottom 10% of the portfolio on a regular
basis? And I've got a follow up, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

I would say that we have a standard practice of paring components of our portfolio, and I'm speaking here about
the Upstream. Paring components of our portfolio where we find that it's not going to continue to attract the
capital that it needs to perform well, where we feel others might find more value in that asset. So we will continue
to do that paring.
I think about a year and a half ago or so, I'm a little shy on the timing, but at fourth quarter 2000 and – last year I
think it was, 2011 the Cook Inlet sale occurred. So that's just a good example of continued paring of the portfolio.
I will say on balance we're very happy with our portfolio because you see it in our earnings margins and you see it
in our cash margins, so on balance we like the assets that we have. Having said that, we obviously look for
opportunities to pare if we think the asset has more value to somebody else and it's not going to compete in our
portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

That doesn't sound [indiscernible] (29:03) particularly material [indiscernible] your assessment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

I think that's true. That's fair. Normally you can expect for the enterprise somewhere between $1 and $3 billion of
asset sales in a given year. Over the last few years, more recently, we have had a little bit heavier restructuring
occurring in our downstream segment so that effort is largely behind us and so you wouldn't expect that
continuing size to go forward in 2013.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

My follow up is really – I guess it's kind of a related issue but we monitor, if you like, the capture rate on your
upstream business and for most of last year it was, I won't give numbers but let's assume it was relatively low and
in Q1 we saw a big jump in your international margins relative to your rate of revenues if you like. Is something
changed there? Was there an absence of maintenance that's more sustainable going forward or to Paul's point, has
there been any kind of incremental tax changes that have led to that rebound? I'm just trying to understand how
sustainable this might be on a go-forward basis because it was quite a significant number relative to what we were
expecting.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

You're talking about our upstream international margins?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

International margins, yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Right. I think really when you look at 2012 if you look at the whole quarterly pattern for 2012 you'll get a
significant deterioration in the third quarter really associated with the downtime at TCO. Now we have really just
moved back up into what would be a more normal pattern. That impact of the downturn in the third quarter and
re-ramping back up here in the fourth quarter, you can see in last year's results.

Q

Doug T. Terreson
Analyst, International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.

Pat, I wanted to see if you'd provide an update on the situation in Argentina and also the plan or next steps for
Kurdistan for 2013 if there are any?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay, well, Argentina, we continue work with YPF on the Vaca Muerta discussion. We are hopeful that, that will
be able to be concluded. So far we've drilled about three shale wells on our existing acreage and we're encouraged
by the results that we have there. There are some above-ground complications, I guess I would say, that exist in
Ecuador as they relate to Ecuador. And we need to have satisfactory resolution of those above-ground
complications before we proceed in a material way on Vaca Muerta.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Doug T. Terreson

Yeah, and, Pat, could you provide a little color on that point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. Well, basically, Ecuador...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

No, no, no just the Argentina component. I'm sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Argentina? Okay. So right now I guess I would call it a partial freeze of assets in Ecuador. It really hasn't impacted
our liquidity in a substantial way. We've been able to modify our liquidity provisions and so operationally we're in
good shape. There is a freeze underway. We are basically petitioning to the Supreme Court in Argentina to have
them review that case. I don't know when the Supreme Court may take it up or if they will take it up. We're
certainly hopeful that they will take it up.

Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Jason D. Gammel
Analyst, Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.

Thank you. I just wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions on the exploration success in the quarter. First of
all on Coronado, you're obviously in a pretty good neighborhood there. Can you talk about any follow-on drilling
plans that you have, I believe that you're about to spud a sidetrack or maybe already have spud a sidetrack on the
discovery well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Well, not really sure what I want to be saying here on Coronado. We do like the area. Let's see here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

A

So we're still evaluating that, Jason. We have spud a sidetrack on it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

But there's not much more we really want to say on it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

A

Not right now. It's still under evaluation.

Q

Okay. That's fine. And then maybe if I could just shift to the Australian exploration success. You've obviously
between drilling results and then the swap you had with Shell, for Carnarvon Basin versus Browse Basin, quite a
bit of incremental gas. Now you talked about being able to move into the Gorgon feed for a Train 4 relatively soon.
Given the gas you've accumulated, when do you think you can actually start evaluating Train 3 at Wheatstone?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, I think that is more distant, certainly. I think we need to get Trains 1 and 2 up and moving forward. We're
only the second year into that whole development construction phase here for Wheatstone. So I think it will come.
It is a hugely prolific area, as you know. And with both the Kentish Knock and the Elfin-1 prospect, we continue to
add. So the more that whole region continues to add to our gas holdings then it gives us more flexibility about
which particular gas molecule we send to which particular plant. So I think you should think of it as after
discussions around Train 4 for Gorgon for any further expansion of Wheatstone.

Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Hey, guys. Nigeria GTL, are we still on track for the year end startup? And based on your experience with the GTL
I presume that you're probably not interested in a GTL plant in the U.S. natural gas market?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

So with regard to EGTL, we are in the process here of commissioning the plant. It is a complex plant and the
commissioning activity really goes on for the bulk of this year, for the rest of this year. I would say we don't see –
GTL would not rank high in terms of our project alternatives for U.S. natural gas.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

And in Nigeria, Pat, the production dropped a little bit but we thought you said it should be continue to be
ramping up. Is there any PSCs effect related to the Nigerian production? Or just natural underlying decline rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

There is no PSC effect there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

A
Well, I'd say there are some cost recoveries there, Paul. So investment levels were slightly lower between quarters
and so we had lower cost oil barrels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

And that's really a timing issue, not anything more sustaining than that. Timing of investments and therefore the
timing of cost recovery barrels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Can I just sneak in a real quick one for clarification? On the favorable tax impact for the international E&P do you
have an absolute dollar amount in the first quarter? You show in the chart saying that sequentially is a benefit of
$214 million. What is the absolute dollar amount in the first quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Right. And we're not going to disclose that. Again, I think the important point about this is to understand that that
was a timing event associated with moving some projects through various project milestones and the taxes that
are triggered commensurate with that. For the overall year you should think about the overall effective rate for the
company as being in the low 40%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

All right. Thank you.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Faisel H. Khan
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)

Q

Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to actually get some clarification on the downstream business. You guys
mentioned a lot of sort of downtime between Pascagoula, El Segundo, Burnaby, South Africa, Richmond, the
Yeosu refinery upgrade, I'm just trying to digest all of that. Could you guys just let us know what was down and
what's back up and at full production right now? And maybe give us a little bit more detail on the upgrader here?
Was this – are you going to consume more heavy oil at Yeosu? And I just have a follow-up, thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Right. Okay. So I think what we can say, we really have said already. So El Segundo and Pascagoula are back at
normal operating levels. Richmond crude unit is just now taking feed, and we will continue to line that out over
the next several days. So certainly as we progress through the quarter, you should expect that to be back to full
operation. The down time at the smaller refineries, the same sort of circumstance has occurred. So it was just a
very heavy first quarter maintenance period.
You should expect the second quarter will be substantially back, fully operational. We don't go into specific details
about which units we have down at which plants for which duration for commercial reasons, and I'm sure you can
appreciate that. And then in terms of South Korea here, we did have the new VGO/FCC up and online with onspec product during the first quarter. It's a 53,000 barrel-a-day plant. It does allow us to process heavier oil.

Q

Faisel H. Khan
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)

Okay. Got it. Perfect. And then my follow up is just on the Marcellus. Is there any chance you would give us, sort
of, how production has grown for you in the Marcellus last year to this year? So you talked about it in I guess in
your prepared remarks, but just trying to understand how much growth you've seen out of that particular asset of
yours.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

So that – so I'll take that. That – there has been production growth between year-on-year quarters. And a lot of
that is driven in the U.S. by both the Marcellus and the Mid-continent for us, which is effectively the Permian and
some of the assets we picked up from Chesapeake later last year. So Marcellus continue to use the carry...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Yes. Correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

And continue to bring on production.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

And we would expect the Permian component to continue to grow during the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Faisel H. Khan

Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Asit Sen
Analyst, Cowen Securities LLC

Q

Thank you. Good morning. Two quick questions, one on Brazil and one on Australia. So just a follow up on Brazil,
given Frade's start in second quarter and small contribution in 2013, how should we think about Papa Terra, still a
2013 startup or slips into 2014?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Right. So the – we really need to refer you to the operator on this, but the operator has continued to have a 2013
startup.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Asit Sen
Analyst, Cowen Securities LLC

Q

Okay. And then a second on Australia, a more strategic question. In a scenario where floating LNG becomes a
viable, how does it impact your thought process on future LNG trains at either Gorgon or Wheatstone? Any early
thoughts on that would be appreciated, thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Right. So I think the floating LNG obviously is a technology that is still yet to be proven. And my expectation
would be, over time, that that will prove out to be a development design that will be appropriate for certain types
of reservoirs.
In terms of Wheatstone and Gorgon, we're really in a position where we have invested already in the greenfield,
and our best opportunity for further expansion obviously will be brownfield. Brownfield, as you know, can be
much more economic, particularly on the downstream component of the plant. Certainly, we think maybe 15% or
so, 15% to 20% more capital efficient on the downstream side. So we think the brownfield expansion that we have
at Gorgon and Wheatstone, and given the resource size we have at Gorgon and Wheatstone, will allow those
developments when the time is right to be attractive and competitive.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Allen Good
Analyst, Morningstar Research

Q

Good morning. I was just wondering if I could get a follow up on the Marcellus. I guess in March, you announced
you had the $850 million left on the drilling carries there, and running about eight rigs. At your current level,
when would you expect to exhaust that drilling carry? And when you do, would you imagine that you continue on
with that eight-rig drilling program, or would you reduce activity at that time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Right. So the $850 million is the number that we have at this particular point in time. We're not going to continue
to provide interim updates on that. That really is a function of, kind of, the drilling program and the rate at which
the investments occur. Our expectation really is, and I think we've said this for some time here, that our
expectation is that the drilling carry works through a period of what I'll call relatively low U.S. gas prices. It allows
us to understand the reservoir, allow for the – kind of build out the development plan for that basin and by the
time the carry is over it's our expectation that we would be sitting in a stronger U.S. natural gas price
environment.
At the same time, we've had good success in improving the economics of our drilling program in terms of cost per
well. The footprint per well and also the environmental impacts per well. So we're very pleased with the progress
we've been able to make and we're happy to have the carry and we'll continue to prosecute the plan over the next
12, 18, 24 months just as we have in the last couple of years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Allen Good
Analyst, Morningstar Research

Q

Okay. And I wonder if I could just get your updated thoughts on the acquisition front? Obviously you did a deal
with Chesapeake last year, a couple years ago, the Atlas deal. What's your view right now as far as valuations are
concerned in the U.S. unconventional space whether it be natural gas or oil and how much opportunity do you see,
today relative to last year given some of the sell off in oil prices and maybe some of the other valuations of these
smaller E&Ps that are out there that may fit into your portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

And I think – I don't want to have a generic statement on this because I think it really does depend on the quality
of the asset in the unconventional space. As we've seen, there's a big difference between sweet spot areas and nonsweet spot areas and we continue to always be focused on the value proposition first and that really stems from
the quality of the asset and in certain times here we have seen that the high-quality assets have been very, very
expensive and that our entry point was really too late.
In another circumstances we have found that, for whatever reason, and Chesapeake I think was a good example of
this, there were certain circumstantial above-ground issues that were faced that we could get in and get a good
value for that. Kitimat in the unconventional space, we feel very pleased with having the opportunity to buy into
that particular project. It's a tremendous resource base and we like the overall dynamics between the partners
now. There's only two partners and we've got a good partner in Apache with a strong capability on the upstream
side and we obviously bring the downstream side. So we tend to look at the overall project and if we can find value
in the overall project, we go forward, but it's not a blanket, gee, everything's overpriced or gee, everything's
underpriced right now. It's very resource-specific and circumstantially specific.

question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pavel S. Molchanov
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Q

Thanks for squeezing me. Just a big-picture question on your overseas unconventionals. One of you European
competitors recently made some very downbeat comments on shale development outside North America. You
guys have been about as active as anyone in accumulating acreage. I'd like to get your latest thoughts on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Pavel, I think we have said – I know George has said that this is a long-term development opportunity. We have
always had the expectation that it would take several years to understand what this play could develop into. You
just don't have the same infrastructure in these European countries as you have in the U.S. You don't have the
same knowledge of the reservoir. In the U.S. of course, the U.S. has been drilled for decades and decades and there
was an awful lot of reservoir knowledge. That is not the case in Europe. In the U.S., we have a lot of service
providers and a lot of infrastructure. In Europe that is not the case. We have well-established fiscal and political
regimes here. As it relates to hydrocarbons that's not always the case in Europe. So there are a number of
differences between the U.S. environment and the European environment and so we have always thought that this
would be a longer-term development opportunity.

Q

Pavel S. Molchanov
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Okay. Just a quick one on Kitimat, is it still your stance that you will only move forward with the project if you can
get crude linked off-take?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Our belief is that selling Kitimat gas into an Asian market will require, I guess I would say, economic provisioning
that will underpin the asset investment. And in our belief, the best mechanism for doing that is the oil linked
contract. So we believe that, that will continue to be the basis that will be needed to spur on the investment for
new LNG developments like a Kitimat.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Hey. Pat, I had two quick ones actually. One in Page 10 of your presentation you show the U.S. downstream a
negative bar of 190 million and you're saying that's primarily related to the down time. Is that just the repay cost
or that's including your estimate of the opportunity cost and if you are not include the opportunity cost, do you
have a rough estimate of how big that may be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

No, I mean it's an analytical derivation to get you the volume bar and what we're really trying to say there is that
compared to last quarter and the volumes that we had running through the equipment and the margins that were
achieved back then relative to this quarter and the margins achieved this year, we break that out between the
volume and margin analyses, various analyses and that's really just trying to say that the primary driver for poorer
U.S. downstream earnings really had to do with having so much of our equipment down: Pascagoula, Richmond,
El Segundo.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

So that's the estimated opportunity cost to you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

No.

Q

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

That's fine. I will just follow-up with Jeff later on. A final one, at the end of the first quarter from an inventory
level you roughly balanced or at a normal level or that you're underlift or overlift and do you have any underlift or
overlift in the first quarter also?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Paul, were slightly over-lifted but it's immaterial, it's less than half a percent in the first quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

How about at the end of the quarter, are you roughly balanced?
