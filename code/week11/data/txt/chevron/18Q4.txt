Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to
Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that
time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr.
Mike Wirth. Please, go ahead.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call
with me today are Pat Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Wayne Borduin, General
Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2.
Back in March, I laid out Chevron's strategy to win in any environment. I outlined our three compelling strengths:
an advantaged portfolio, sustainability at lower prices, and a strong balance sheet. I also indicated that the
combination of these distinct advantages, together with the commitments to action highlighted in blue, would
deliver growing free cash flow and shareholder returns.
In 2018, we delivered. We grew oil and gas production by more than 7%, achieving our highest-ever annual
production. We grew cash margins in our operated upstream assets, contributing to an improvement in cash
returns. We lowered our unit costs, and we sold $2 billion of assets.
These outcomes yielded record free cash flow, a dividend increase, and the initiation of a share repurchase
program. 2018 was a very successful year, and we intend to build on this momentum in 2019.
Turning to slide 4, a view of our sources and uses of cash. Excluding working capital, we generated over $31
billion in cash flow from operations. And we achieved record free cash flow of nearly $17 billion, the highest level
ever achieved by Chevron in any price environment. This allowed us to deliver on all four of our financial priorities.
For the 31st consecutive year, we maintained our commitment to dividend growth and paid out $8.5 billion in cash
dividends to our shareholders. Earlier this week, we announced a $0.07 per share increase in our quarterly
dividend to $1.19 per share, representing a 6% increase.
Second, we allocated capital across a diverse portfolio and funded our highest-return projects. We have
confidence these investments position us for sustainable growth and free cash flow. Third, we strengthened our
balance sheet and paid down debt by $4.5 billion. Finally, we began repurchasing shares in the third quarter and
increased the rate in the fourth quarter, demonstrating further confidence in our future cash generation.
With that, I will turn the call over to Pat, who will take you through the financial results. Pat?

Hey, thanks, Mike. Turning to slide 5, an overview of our financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings were
$3.7 billion or $1.95 per diluted share. 2018 full year earnings were $14.8 billion or $7.74 per diluted share, up
more than 60% from 2017.
In the quarter, foreign exchange gains of $268 million were offset by a special item related to a project write-off. A
detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation.
For the full year, earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, totaled $15.5 billion. Return on capital
employed for 2018 was 8.2%, up from 5% in 2017. Our debt ratio at year-end was 18%, and our net debt ratio
was approximately 14%.
During the fourth quarter, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends, bringing the full year total to $8.5 billion. And we
increased the rate of our share repurchases from $750 million in the third quarter to $1 billion in the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide 6. For the full year, cash flow from operations totaled $30.6 billion, about 50% higher than 2017.
Headwinds, as we've defined them in the past, totaled $3.2 billion for the year, in line with my original guidance.
For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $9.2 billion. It was lower than in the third quarter primarily because
of lower commodity prices, but it was well above first quarter when prices were comparable. This improvement
within the year was due to the growth in production.
Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4 billion and $13.8 billion for the year. The resulting free cash
flow of almost $17 billion reduced our dividend breakeven price. We are covering our cash CapEx and dividend at
just under $53 Brent, without consideration of asset sale proceeds. Before moving off cash flow, a little guidance
for 2019. If prices hold at current levels, we expect headwinds for 2019 to be between $2 billion and $3 billion.
Now, onto slide 7. Full year 2018 earnings of $14.8 billion were approximately $5.6 billion higher than 2017.
Special items, primarily the absence of a U.S. tax reform gain of $2 billion, lower gains on asset sales and an
increase in charges relating to project write-offs, resulted in a net $3.9 billion decrease in earnings. A swing in
foreign exchange impacts benefited earnings between the periods by $1.1 billion.
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by about $9.3 billion between
periods, primarily because of higher realizations and increased liftings. Slightly offsetting were higher operating
expenses largely associated with continued ramp-up in production along with additional taxes and other costs.
Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by just over $90 million. Lower
volumes reflected the sales of our Canadian and South African refining and marketing assets, while higher
operating expenses were associated with planned turnaround activity in the U.S. These items were mostly offset
by favorable timing effects and improved results at CPChem.
In the other segment, excluding special items and foreign exchange, net charges for the period increased by
almost $750 million, due primarily to higher interest expense and lower tax deductibility for corporate charges. Full
year net charges were $2.3 billion, in line with our guidance. Our 2019 guidance for the other segment remains
about $2.4 billion in net charges. As a reminder, though, quarterly results in this segment are non-ratable.

Now, on slide 8. 2018 production was 2.93 million barrels a day, an increase of 202,000 barrels a day or more
than 7% from 2017. This is the highest level of production in the company's history. Excluding the impact of 2018
asset sales, production grew approximately 8% or 1% above the top of the guidance range we provided last
January.
Major capital projects increased production by 227,000 barrels a day, as we continue to ramp up production at
multiple projects, most significantly Wheatstone and Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased 132,000
barrels a day, primarily in the Permian, where production grew by more than 70% from 2017.
Base declines, net of production from new wells mostly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria, were 19,000
barrels a day. The impact of asset sales, in particular from the U.S. Mid-Continent, Gulf of Mexico shelf and the
Elk Hills Field in California, reduced production by 50,000 barrels per day.
Entitlement effects, in total, reduced production by 46,000 barrels per day, 17,000 of which was due to the effect
of higher prices during the year. Higher planned turnaround effects, primarily at Angola LNG and Tengiz, reduced
production between years by 26,000 barrels per day.
I will now hand it back to Mike.

Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide 9, reserve replacement continues to be a real success story. In 2018, our reserve
replacement ratio was 136%. We added almost 400 million more barrels than we produced and divested. This
outcome is especially significant because it was achieved while growing production more than 7%.
Our reserves to production ratio stands at a healthy 11.3 years, showing the strength and sustainability of our
portfolio. Our five-year reserve replacement ratio of 117% further illustrates that strength through the price
downturn.
Moving to slide 10. We continue to maintain our commitment to capital discipline. Total C&E in 2018 was $20.1
billion. This included approximately $600 million of inorganic spend for which we don't budget, primarily related to
bonus payments for offshore leases in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico.
The stacked bar depicts our organic C&E budget for 2019 of $20 billion. Within this budget, the cash component
is $13.7 billion, while the remaining $6.3 billion is expenditures by affiliates, primarily TCO and CPChem.
In the 2019 budget, $3.6 billion is allocated to the Permian and another $1.6 billion is allocated to other shale and
tight assets. We expect approximately 70% of our total 2019 spend to deliver cash within two years. Our current
spend profile has significantly lower execution risk relative to the past, when we had several large-scale major
capital projects underway concurrently.
Turning to slide 11, I'd like to provide an update on our portfolio optimization efforts. During 2018, we received
before tax asset sale proceeds of $2 billion, with the largest contributors being the divestment of our Southern
Africa refining and marketing business and our interests in the Elk Hills Field in California.
We recently completed the sale of our interest in the Rosebank project, West of Shetland in the UK. In addition,
we expect to close the sale of our interest in the Danish Underground Consortium in the first half of 2019. And
earlier this week, we executed an agreement to sell our interest in the Frade Field in Brazil.


We continue marketing our UK Central North Sea and Azerbaijan assets. As with all divestments, we're focused
on generating good value from any transaction. The progress we made last year is consistent with our guidance
of $5 billion to $10 billion in asset sale proceeds from 2018 to 2020.
Turning to the Permian, production in the fourth quarter was 377,000 barrels per day, up 172,000 barrels per day
or 84% relative to the same quarter last year. Annual production was up more than 70%. In the Permian, we
remain focused on returns. We're not chasing our production target, nor are we altering our plans based on the
price of the day.
Over the last two years, we transacted more than 150,000 acres through swaps, joint ventures, farm-outs and
sales, further optimizing our large land position. In 2018, we had takeaway capacity for oil and liquids that was
more than sufficient. And we've already added more capacity this year.
We're pleased with our position and leading performance in the Permian. In just two years, we've doubled our rig
count, increased our resource base, decreased unit development and operating costs and more than doubled our
production. We'll provide new guidance for our Permian portfolio in March.
Moving to LNG, the plants at Gorgon and Wheatstone performed well during the fourth quarter and averaged
almost 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was despite higher summer temperatures in December.
Higher temperatures, as you know, generally reduce LNG throughput. We loaded 329 LNG cargoes from Gorgon
and Wheatstone last year. We've now commissioned the Wheatstone domestic gas plant and expect to provide
gas to the local market in the next few weeks.
We begin our routine cycle of planned turnarounds at Gorgon this year. We'll be on a four-year cycle, with one
train undergoing maintenance each of the first three years and the fourth year having no turnarounds scheduled.
We expect turnarounds at the Gorgon trains to last about 40 days. These turnarounds offer the opportunity to
perform routine maintenance, and also to make small enhancements that increase reliability and throughput. We
anticipate significant cash generation from these assets for many years to come.
Slide 14 shows our production outlook for this year, assuming a $60 Brent price. We expect production to be 4%
to 7% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2019 asset sales. Our growth is largely driven by shale
and tight assets and full-year production from Train 2 at Wheatstone. These forecasts always need to
acknowledge the uncertainties in our business, as noted on the slide. In summary, we anticipate a third
consecutive year of strong production growth.
Moving to slide 15, as announced earlier this week, we've signed an agreement with Petrobras America Inc. to
purchase its 110,000 barrel per day refinery and related assets in Pasadena, Texas. This addition to our Gulf
Coast refining system allows us to process more domestic light crude, supply a portion of our retail market in
Texas and Louisiana with Chevron produced products, and realize regional synergies through coordination with
our refinery in Pascagoula. We expect to close by mid-year and we'll provide further updates at our analyst
meeting in March.
Now, just a few comments about future expectations. We expect positive production trends to continue in the first
quarter and throughout 2019, reflected in the 4% to 7% growth forecast. In as early as first quarter, we expect
additional co-lending to TCO in support of the future growth project.
In downstream, we expect low refinery turnaround activity in the first quarter, which as you'll recall from our
previous disclosure, equates to an estimated after-tax earnings impact of less than $100 million. Earlier in the call,
Pat provided you guidance on cash flow headwinds and corporate charges for 2019. And as we communicated
earlier this week, there will be a $0.07 per share quarterly dividend increase, and we anticipate $1 billion in share
repurchases during the quarter.
Moving to slide 17, I'd like to share a few closing thoughts. As I mentioned before, we intend to win in any
environment. As a result of our advantaged portfolio, capital discipline, lower execution risk, strong balance sheet
and record-level free cash flow, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns.
That concludes our prepared remarks and we're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have
a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary, and we'll do our best to
get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from
JPMorgan. Your question, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil M. Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Yes. Hey, good morning, Mike and Pat.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Good morning, Phil.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil M. Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

First question, you talked about the dividend breakeven of $53 in 2018. You've stepped up the dividend here at a
higher rate than last year, and you're also stepping up the buyback. So, I guess, maybe if you could just elaborate
a little bit on this, on the breakeven, where you see that going. Is it moving lower and giving you more confidence
in the more return of capital or just how you think about that calculus?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, Phil, we worked really hard over the last few years to get that breakeven down. We were in the 80s not that
long ago and have made significant progress in bringing the dividend breakeven down. We've provided, I think, a
kind of a simple way to think about it in some of our prior definitions.
And as we look forward in 2019, we think the dividend breakeven remains in the area where it was from last year.
You see we've got really strong cash flows coming in right now, and the commitment to a competitive increase in
the dividend, the confidence to step up the rate of share, repurchases, is evidence of our confidence that we've
got those cash flows coming in and in a price environment – any reasonable price environment, as Pat has said,
that we'll be able to sustain those kinds of payouts.

The other thing I will just point out is our capital spending is still the same. And we've got the ability to provide
strong production growth, sustain the kind of cash margins that you've seen out of our portfolio, and do that at
really modest capital spending relative to our history.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil M. Gresh

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Sure. Okay. Thank you. The second question, I guess, would just be on that capital spending budget, specifically
for 2019. The Permian piece, pretty flattish year-over-year, which I think you highlighted last quarter. The nonPermian shale piece is stepping up quite a bit here. And I just want to know if you could maybe elaborate on that
a little bit. Not to steal any thunder from the Analyst Day, but is that something that is going to be contributing to
this 2019 production growth guidance or is that something that you're ramping in 2019, it would be more of a
future contribution?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Well, we are beginning to ramp in the other basins. So we've added rigs actually in all the other shale and tight
basins in which we operate. We have seen significant reductions in development costs in the Marcellus, in the
Duvernay and in the Vaca Muerta. As we've shared the learnings and improvements that are emanating from the
large-scale activity we have in the Permian, the economics on each of these are compelling. The EURs are
coming up.
And while the Permian may be in the spotlight within our shale and tight portfolio, it's far from the only asset that
we have. The other thing that I'd just note is we've begun an eight-well appraisal program in El Trapial in the north
of the Vaca Muerta. We're currently producing in the southern area, Loma Campana. But our folks are intrigued
by the possibilities up in the north at El Trapial and we continue to prosecute that program.
We've also picked up additional acreage in the Narambuena, 25,000 net acres where we are non-operated with
YPF, and we've got a four-well pilot that we plan to execute there in 2019 as well. So, great potential in Argentina.
And we really like our entire shale and tight portfolio, and again, it brings some of the characteristics we've been
talking about, which is short cycle time, attractive economics, low development costs, and the ability to generate
cash relatively rapidly. The last thing I'll say about that is it brings a much lower risk profile than multiyear,
multibillion-dollar capital projects.

Phil M. Gresh

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Okay. Thanks. Mike. And, Pat, what was the amount of the co-lend for TCL?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

In 2018, the co-lend was zero.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil M. Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

No, for the 1Q guide. I'm sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

The 1Q guide. Okay, so I don't have, I guess, I would say a confirmed number here for you because it will depend
on what happens to price. It will depend on what happens – and how cash flow that's generated from operations
matches against the investment profile for the project. It will also depend on the dividend distribution requirements
for the partners.
But I think order of magnitude, if you go back and you look at 2016 when we first started the co-lending, that was
about $2 billion. And I think as an order of magnitude, starting off base, maybe think about $2 billion for this year.
But as I say, we reserve the right to change that number as the year progresses and we see what actually
happens to prices and the investment profile and as discussions are underway on dividends.

Q

You talk about Argentina. I'm wondering, given the political environment, the infrastructure or lack of infrastructure
over there, how quickly you think you can proceed with the development plan? And any kind of timeline or the
pace or the capital outlook that – any kind of data that you can share?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

We'll probably talk about this a little bit more in March, Paul. But I'd just reiterate, YPF has been a very, very good
partner there. The Macri government is committed to improving the investment climate in Argentina, and has
instituted a number of reforms to encourage and support energy development in the country.

We have great resource there that's benefiting from the Permian learnings and competitive economics, multiple
blocks that we've picked up. And much of the production can actually stay in the country.
So, at this point, yes, the infrastructure is not developed the way that it is in the United States or perhaps North
America more broadly, but there's a commitment on the part of the government to do that. And we'll pace our
development with gas and liquids takeaway and market conditions.
So the realities on the ground in Argentina are a little bit different, but I got to say the resource is tremendous and
we're very encouraged by the policy reforms that have been put forth by the government.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng

Q

Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

And for Pasadena, the refinery that you just bought, what's the game plan for that facility? I mean, are you going
to need to make a significant investment upfront to bring them to the Chevron standard? Because that facility
probably has been under-invested at least for 20, if not 30-plus years, and that labor relationship has been always
very rocky. So what's the game plan and how much is the upfront investment?
And secondly, are you going to run it as a full-blown facility or that is sort of by an extension of Pascagoula?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. Okay. So let me try to respond to that, Paul, as best I can. We just executed an agreement this week. We
don't expect to close here until somewhat later here in the first half of the year. So it's a little premature for me to
lay out an investment plan until we actually close the transaction. In the due diligence, we've satisfied ourselves
that we can operate the facility safely and reliably at the standards that we would expect. And so, I don't think you
should have any concerns there.
It meets our kind of three primary criteria. One, we're getting it at a good price. And I believe one of the ways that
you take risk out of refinery acquisitions is you don't overpay; and I don't think that we're overpaying for the asset.
It's in a great location, and that allows us to integrate to increasing light crude production out of West Texas. It
allows us to serve our markets in Texas with the product that we run through our own system as opposed to
exchange or purchase product. And it will allow us to optimize and integrate with the Pascagoula refinery.
The third thing is it provides good, strong economics. And because of our system and the three kind of strategic
levers that I just talked about, we ought to be able to optimize that refinery as a part of our system in a way that is
different than what the current owner can, simply because they don't have those other assets and those other
positions.
And so, within our business, this fills a bit of a gap. It gives us the ability to capture value in multiple different
dimensions. And, over time, we'll evaluate what investments we may choose to make there as we would in any
other refinery. I would expect those to be relatively modest. I would expect them to be thoughtfully paced over
time and to fit within the level of spending that we've established over the past many years in our downstream
business.

please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Good morning, Mike and Pat and Wayne here. The first question I had was around Tengiz and the latest on the
project. Are you feeling good about the timeline and thoughts on costs and the contingency as well/
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. Neil, so I probably don't have a lot to add to what we've previously said on this. We're still on schedule, so
we're still targeting a 2022 startup. As I think Jay mentioned on our third quarter call, on-site productivity has
improved. We had a very good summer. The logistics are working very well as we're moving modules now from
Korea to the staging points.
We can't move through the inland waterway system during the winter time because it freezes up, but modules are
arriving from Korea, from Italy and from Kazakhstan. The quality levels are very high. We're about halfway
through the project, about 50% complete at this point.
And 2019 will be a key year. There's a lot of activity in terms of moving modules into the Caspian to the site, a lot
of field work where we'll see if these productivity gains can be built upon again in 2019. And it's certainly a year
where we will reduce uncertainty.
Jay is actually headed there this weekend and will be there next week. And when we get to New York in March,
he will have had recent field visits to Kazakhstan and also to Korea. He was in Korea visiting the module
fabrication yards last week, and he will be in a position to give you very good insight into exactly where we stand
and what our expectations are.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Yeah. Looking forward to that. And the follow-up, we just want to get some more color on the share buyback, to
follow-up on Phil's question. I think most of us were expecting $750 million. It came in at $1 billion in the fourth
quarter. As we think about the share buyback program, our view had been that this program would be kind of a
base load $3 billion program into perpetuity, but you're demonstrating that you're willing to flex and lean into it. So
can you talk about the philosophy behind that share repurchase program? Is a higher run rate potentially
sustainable? And how you think about flexing it from a big picture? And then, a more granular perspective?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. I'm going to let Pat take that.
Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay. So, Neil, thanks for the question. And I think the key word here is sustainability. And what you saw with our
increase was just our view of our future cash generation, the confidence that we have in our future cash
generation and a belief that we could move that rate of quarterly purchase up to $4 billion. When we first initiated
this back in the second quarter call, the points that I made were that we really wanted to have this be through the
cycle and sustainable through the cycle. And so, we pegged it at $3 billion because we thought that would be
supportable through any reasonable price environment.
We obviously had stronger prices in 2018, and now they've come off a little bit. But we still feel very strong about
our cash generation in 2019 and, frankly, in the years to come. You will note – maybe you won't note, but we did
release an 8-K this morning as well that talk to the fact that our board has supported a resolution for a $25 billion
share repurchase program with no term limit. So I think that $25 billion gives you an indication of the commitment
that we have to this program, our view about the sustainability. And I think that should be a very strong message
to our investors about our willingness and intent to boost shareholder distribution.

please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gammel

Q

Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Thanks very much. Hello, folks. I wanted to ask a question about the cost structure of the company. And the
reason I ask is you've already taken a lot of cost out of the upstream, but you seem to be with divestitures and
some explorations, concentrating more and more into the highest-quality assets.
I'm just wondering if there is the potential to take further overhead out of the business through medium-term
shutting down regional offices, et cetera. I mean, this seems to be right out of the Mike Wirth downstream
playbook of taking further cost out and enhancing returns through concentration.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Well, Jason, I'll give you A short answer, and the answer is yes. I think in a commodity business, you always have
to be looking for efficiencies and I think scale matters, and we need to continue to look for ways to control our own
destiny. And a big part of that is moving into assets that have inherently lower cost structures and continually
seeking an efficient overhead structure to support that.
I will tell you that not only can you do that through what I would call conventional means and the way that it's
always been done, but technology today offers us the ability to do even more. As we bring digital technologies
into our business and can do things in a business that really grew up in an analog world, there is a lot of
opportunity to find more efficiencies.
The other thing, when you're growing your business, it's important to pay attention to unit costs. And we've seen
unit costs come down significantly. We see this year, another 2% reduction or so in unit costs. And as you look
out to 2020 and 2021, I think that number can go up even more in terms of the percent reduction. Or the other
way to say it is unit costs can come down even more.
So, we need to be prepared to be competitive in an environment where prices are not what we look to, and we'll
continue to work on cost efficiencies across our entire portfolio.

Yes. So, we've got the first well online and it's been performing very well. It came on in November of last year.
The second well is being drilled and completed as we speak, and we anticipate that coming on here in the first
quarter. And so, we'll steadily move through the process of adding wells at Big Foot, and you can expect that to
be part of the net production story in 2019.

please.

Q

Good morning. You mentioned that you've got about 150,000 acres of swaps or sales, I believe, in the Permian,
Mike. And hi, Pat, by the way. Sorry, I was slightly caught off-guard there. I wanted just an update on where your
final numbers are for Permian acreage and how you feel about that given that there's potentially some fairly major
assets available. I guess, you're strongly outperforming your volume targets.

Can you also talk about your returns there because there's concerns that you're perhaps not as leading edge as
we might want you to be in terms of your Permian performance on a returns basis? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yes. So, we'll share a lot more detail in March because as you can see, the performance out of the Permian
continues to be exceptionally strong. With the large land position that we have, we've got good currency and
optionality to try to improve that, because everybody is interested in drilling longer laterals, finding contiguous
development areas. And so, with our 2.2 million net acres and 1.7 million in the Midland and Delaware Basins,
we've got lots of levers with which to optimize our position. And the nice thing about these transactions is they are
truly win-win because you can transact with other people, there is enough economic value creation that you're not
trying to split a finite pie, but you're actually creating a bigger pie for both.
Our currently disclosed resource, there is 11.2 billion barrels, that's a figure we would expect to grow. And so, our
confidence in the Permian is higher today than it was the last time that I spoke to you.
When you're talking about returns, we've put out data before on the returns that we're seeing and they are well up
in the 35%-plus range as we've moved to longer laterals, a better basis of design. And even in a modest price
environment, we're seeing very, very strong returns. It's as good as – and good or better than anything else we
could be doing.
We are returns-driven, and I mentioned that in my prepared remarks and I'll reiterate that. And it's returns across
the lifecycle of the asset and it's returns across the entire value chain. And so, we're not looking to put the most
wells online or have the biggest IPs, we're looking to get the best returns out of the system.
We paused at 20 rigs. For several years, we've been telling you we're going to grow to a 20-rig fleet. And as you
go through that kind of growth, you stress the system a little bit, and so we're pausing in terms of adding rigs at
this point in order to ensure that anything that needs to improve from a performance standpoint will.
We engage in regular benchmarking within the basin. We have a number of non-operated joint ventures. We've
got really good visibility into what other operators are doing and what levels they're performing at. And I'll simply
tell you that we are continuing to improve performance in every dimension and intend to continue to, and using
benchmarking to identify the areas where we can get better.
So, Jay will talk a lot more about this in March. We'll have a breakout session that will give you a chance to go
into detail with questions as well, but we feel like we're delivering better performance.
And across the value chain, I mentioned we've been well-situated with takeaway capacity. And we've added
capacity already in 2019, so we're able to capture margin across the value chain, and later this year, that will
include refining margin.

Q

Thanks, Mike. And we know also that you've got an advantaged mineral right position there, which seems to be
one of the issues with any potential major deals that might occur in the Permian in the near future.
Mike, if I could ask you another one. I was going to make some elaborate joke about you keeping it competitive by
not having just the CEO on the call, but also the CFO. But obviously, referring to Exxon's CEO being on the call
this morning. There is a number of major differentiations between the two companies and one of them is your flat
CapEx outlook. I think that you would do well to maintain that. I think it is a relatively long-term outlook as it
stands. You've just drifted towards the top of the range without going above it. What are the prospects of you
actually seeing falling CapEx and CapEx that surprises to the downside going forward given that your growth
trajectory looks very good for a company of your size? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yes, so we're committed to capital discipline. We can grow our business at modest capital levels, and we've got
more good things to invest in than we will invest in. And last year, there are two notable examples. We
relinquished our rights to the Tigris development project in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, not because it's not a
good project, not because it can't generate a return, but we have better opportunities within our portfolio. Same
thing with Rosebank, a good project, a lot of resource, but one that probably fits better for someone else than it
does for us given our alternatives to invest. And so, we will continue to make those kinds of choices.
The one thing that came up in the call earlier were the other shale and tight opportunities, and those are really
economic as well. And so, there's opportunities for us to, whether you're talking in the Permian or some of these
other areas, over time to find highly attractive opportunities to invest further capital, generate strong returns,
minimize execution risk, short cycle. And as our portfolio grows, we were up 5% in production two years ago, 7%
last year, we've just outlined 4% to 7% this year, a growing portfolio over time does require modestly higher base
capital spending that would go with that.
And so, we're committed to capital discipline, and I think you have characterized our ability to grow at relatively
flat capital well. We'll update forward views beyond what we've already articulated when we get to the March
meeting. Thanks, Paul.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Blake M. Fernandez
Analyst, Simmons Energy

Q

Hey, folks, good morning. Two questions for you. One, could you talk a little bit about Venezuela? I know it's early
days, but obviously, you do have exposure there, both upstream and downstream. And just any helpful thoughts
that might help us out on our end.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, I can give you a quick update on Venezuela, Blake. The first and most important thing for us is the safety of
our people on the ground, and so that's what we're really focused on. We also want to be sure the operations
where we have an interest are safe and environmentally sound, and I can tell you that, that is the case. We've
worked closely with the government to be sure that we understand the intent of the sanctions. There has been a
number of new general licenses issued by the Treasury Department. And so, we're in close consultation to be
sure we understand them and how they are to be applied.

And I will say that the U.S. government has been very interested in engaging with us to understand our position
on the ground. And we continue to operate and I think for the foreseeable future, we feel like we can maintain a
good stable operation and a safe operation on the ground in Venezuela.
If you look at it from the downstream side in the U.S., Pascagoula is the one refinery of ours that tends to run
Venezuelan crude. And it runs kind of 70,000 barrels, 75,000 barrels, give or take. For some time, the prospects
of actions like this have been clear, and so we've had contingency plans in place, we've got alternate sourcing.
We've got plenty of crude in-tank for Pascagoula. We've got crude on the water there, and so we're good here for
the balance of the first quarter and maybe even a little bit beyond. And we have activated our contingency
planning into a full scale execution right now. So, we'll keep the refinery full with crude. We'll optimize, and I think
we feel like we're going to be able to navigate through this. Our biggest hope is for stability on the ground in
Venezuela and the safety of not only our employees, but our contractors and the people in Venezuela.

Blake M. Fernandez

Q

Okay. Appreciate that. The second question, I know you've kind of covered Pasadena and we'll get some
additional color in March, but just more broadly speaking, I think you've kind of alluded to a potential acquisition of
a refinery on the Gulf Coast for some time. The size of this is 110,000 barrels a day or so, which isn't small, but
it's not really large in context of some of the Gulf Coast facilities. Does this satisfy kind of your appetite or
integration potential there or do you think there's additional scope to kind of expand that over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

I don't want to speculate. We've got one transaction here that we've signed an agreement on. The key is value
and the ability for it to not only yield value on a standalone basis, but to integrate into our network and be sure we
can capture value out of that. So, we're focused on that with the Pasadena refinery, and I think I'll just leave it at
that.

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

I know all the really fun stuff has got to wait till March, but maybe to take a look at your CapEx mix. You
mentioned 70% has a two-year or less weighting to cash flow, whereas the rest, obviously, longer. Do you think
as we – not so much look at a total CapEx number, but the mix within that CapEx, does that start to change back
over the next couple years?
I'm thinking, number one, you signed a long-term deepwater rig contract obviously aimed at some of the more
challenging parts of the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. So as things like that start to come in, do we see that start to
move maybe to more of a 50-50 on CapEx? Or is that something you want to maintain maybe more at the 70-30
level as we think over the next several years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. Roger, it's a good question because our mix has shifted very dramatically from where it was not long ago
and it's come down by 50% from the high watermark and it's shifted in terms of its makeup; I think both really
important issues. And going back to Paul Sankey's question, I think that is the new normal for us. We've got in
this year's budget, a little bit over $5 billion for shale and tight, $3.6 billion in the Permian, $1.6 billion on other
shale and tight. And, over time, I think that number is likely to grow rather than shrink.
We've got FGP, which is in the peak spending years this year and next. And so, that's a non-trivial amount, a little
bit over $4 billion in this year's budget. And so, as that moves past the peak and comes down, it creates room for
other things. And that could include deepwater, it could include more shale and tight or other major capital
projects.
On the deepwater, our intent would be to have a ratable development program. And I think one of the things that
we have learned over this past cycle, or I mentioned we have many large MCPs underway simultaneously, is that
that introduces execution risk that is real. And so, our intent would be to have a balanced approach as we go
forward and not to find ourselves so overly skewed to that kind of risk that it becomes an issue that's difficult to
manage.
And because we've got the really strong shale and tight portfolio, I think that, plus our base business which again
requires investment, but is typically short cycle and quick to go from capital spent to cash in the door, I think the
kind of range that we're in today is more likely to, plus or minus, be the range you would see in the future as
opposed to something that flips back the other direction.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

Okay. Thanks for that. And then, just to beat the Pasadena refining horse a little bit harder here, part of the
acquisition indicated some undeveloped acreage. Are we wrong to think about this as just a refining acquisition
and maybe should think about it more as an infrastructure opportunity across the board? I'm thinking we're
moving more and more towards crude exports from the U.S.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

No. I think there's a reason we disclosed that because the asset there is not simply the refinery, but it's the port
access, it's the tankage and it's the land. And I mentioned a couple of times that our goal is to integrate this into
our system. That means our upstream system, our downstream system, our trading system. And when I was a
young pup, one of the lessons I learned from a seasoned engineer in one of our refineries is he said, the
cheapest process unit we have in this refinery is called a tank.
And so, there are times when we can fall in love with building complex equipment, and there are realities that you
can create optionality and margin through infrastructure and commercial activity at relatively low investment. And I
think this asset offers us the opportunity to not just participate in the refining margin, but also to look at the other
ways that, through our integrated system, we can capture value across the entire value chain, both up and
downstream. And that's the way we're approaching this.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your
question, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Sam Margolin
Analyst, Wolfe Research

Q

Good morning. How are you? Mike, I'm going to try to not ask you to say the same thing again in a different way.
But one of the outcomes of the much faster-than-expected Permian growth is maybe that the free cash flow
profile of the Permian as a stand-alone entity has been pulled forward significantly. And maybe that's sort of an
obvious statement or it's not new, but it seems like that's an important pendulum swing with respect to how you
might think about additional long-cycle projects.
So among all these other factors that you've commented on kind of pointing you to thinking about expanding the
portfolio in deepwater or other long-cycle areas, is that something that's important too or is that more something
that's on plan and you're just thinking about that within the buyback and the dividend growth and all your other
sort of uses of cash that are out there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. So I think the increased performance of the Permian is a good news story. We did spend a little more
capital last year because we're finding that we can drill more hole, we've changed our basis of design. So a little
bit of the capital overrun was related to the good news story that we're getting a lot more production out of the
Permian. And our guidance has been we're free cash flow positive in 2020, and I think that's still a good way for
you to think about it.

As we reach the crossover point, it crosses over. And we've increased the dividend, that Pat's already addressed
the confidence in increasing the rate at which we're repurchasing shares and our intent to sustain that through the
cycle.
Having strong free cash flow creates alternatives. And we intend to use the free cash flow to be very mindful of
the need for shareholder distributions and also to look for good investment opportunities. I mentioned we're able
to meet all four priorities this last year in terms of dividend, investment, balance sheet and share repurchases;
and our intent is to continue to respect that going forward. This kind of growth in free cash flow allows us to do
that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Sam Margolin

Q

Analyst, Wolfe Research

Okay. And just on a related note – I guess, this one's for Pat. Leverage came down a lot. Is there a target
leverage to think about conceptually or is it just something that's going to be a function of commodity prices in
terms of the rate at which the balance sheet fluctuates here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Right. Sam, we don't have a target leverage rate. We think of the balance sheet as being the outcome of other
previously outstanding decisions about how we've used the cash that we're generating.
As I've said in the past, maybe a 20% leverage ratio on average through the cycle. And that when you are in a
stronger price environment, you would obviously build back your balance sheet some, and when you're in a
weaker price environment, you'd use it some. And so, I think that's really what we're trying to – that's kind of the
sweet spot or the sweet area that we're trying to play in.
Having a good balance sheet, it's a good insurance policy. And having a good balance sheet allows us for both
dividends and share repurchases to sustain those through any period of price weakness. And we feel that, that's
an important component.

Michael K. Wirth

Yeah, we're still very positive on the petrochemical investment opportunity and particularly here in the United
States. I think it's a good long-term story. We have seen some pressure on margins here recently. Feedstock
costs in the third quarter were up. I think olefin chain margins have been under a little bit of pressure. But these
things happen in commodity markets with long cycle times for projects, and kind of ebbs and flows in the
economy. So, that hasn't fundamentally changed our view on the attractiveness of the sector.

Doug Leggate

Q

Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And, Mike, we always appreciate you getting on these calls, so thanks again
for doing it this time around. Mike, my question might actually be for Pat. Pat, you talked about the $13-plus billion
of cash spending. Can you give us an idea, as the affiliate spending rolls off with Tengiz completed, how do you
anticipate that cash CapEx to trend given that you're holding the line on the $18 billion to $20 billion absolute
spending at least through 2020?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

So, I think Mike has answered that question in a way, although he didn't split out cash versus total headline C&E.
But as you see TCO spending come often as we move towards first production there in 2022, the other affiliate
where we have potentially investment opportunities would be CPChem. And so that – what occurs in that
particular category will be a function of how decisions are made on final investments [indiscernible] (00:56:19), for
example. So, it's not something that I can predict with any degree of certainty.
I think what's important is that the summation of both what I would say company-owned and operated and
affiliate-owned and operated, we're staying within that $18 billion to $20 billion C&E range for the near-term here
certainly, and we'll give you an update in March on a prospectively longer period of time.
But I think capital discipline is a theme that you want to read through all of this. And the fact is that we have the
opportunity to be very judicious and very selective about how we work in additional projects into our queue.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate

Q

I know it's a tough one to answer given all the variables. My follow-up is kind of related, I guess. But if we go back
to 2010, 2011, 2012, through 2014, 2015, obviously, a lot of big oils, yourselves included, were spending much
higher levels than you are today. And one assumes that, that created a lot of cost recovery barrels in some of the
PSCs. So, I guess, my question is to the extent you can, as we look forward in light of Thailand, how do you see
your entitlement barrels trending if you maintain that CapEx at these levels? Do you start to see cost recovery
barrels tail off? If you can maybe offer some quantification of that, I'd appreciate it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Doug, I don't think we've got numbers here that we can isolate for you on that. Cost recovery applies across a
number of locations in our portfolio here. You're obviously aware of what's happened in Indonesia. So, I don't
think I have a pinpointed answer that I can give you on that.

Q

Mike, I have a question about portfolio optimization and specifically, the divestiture part of the plan. And on this
point, you guys have had a pretty active program over the years, but you still also have a decent amount of value
left in the queue.

And so, my question is, is this because the market for assets has softened somewhat or do you consider it to be
kind of normal course of business during the cycle, or is it something else? So, any color on your divestiture
program and the market trends you guys are experiencing is really the question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, I'm not 100% sure I'm tracking with you there, Doug. But we have always had a program of divestitures.
And there are times it's a little higher, there are times it's a little bit higher, but in this business, you're continually
looking to upgrade your portfolio. We've got some things now that are really attractive. And earlier, I mentioned a
couple of things that we stepped away from because we didn't think they would compete for capital.
Divestments are driven by a view on strategic alignments with our broader portfolio and our view of the future, the
resource potential that remains in a particular asset, will it compete for capital within our portfolio? And there are
good things, as I mentioned earlier, that cannot. And then, can we receive fair value? So, that may be a little bit of
a function of what's the macro environment and the forward view on commodity price. But we're in a position that I
think you can expect us to continue to high-grade our portfolio.

activity through other shale and tight, and some of these other basins we've been talking about, Gorgon and
Wheatstone. So, primarily in the unconventionals, but contributions across the board from Australia, Canada,
Asia, Gulf of Mexico, Eurasia. Price was a relatively small negative revision, less than 100 million barrels on price.
We produced just short of 1.1 billion barrels. We sold about 60 million barrels. So, there was not a big price
impact in there. And while unconventionals were the big piece, we had contributions from others.
The one thing that I would call your attention to is what we view as very high quality reserve additions. They are
barrels that bring with them lower risk, that's lower execution risk and lower geologic risk, and lower breakeven
prices. And so, we would expect to continue to have a good strong reserve replacement story as we go forward
given the quality of our portfolio and the continued improvements that we see, particularly in our unconventional
development activities.
