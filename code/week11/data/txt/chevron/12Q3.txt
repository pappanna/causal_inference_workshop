Operator: Good morning. My name is Shawn and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to the
Chevron's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks,
there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As
a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation,
Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.

All right. Thank you, Shawn. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the
call with me today is Mike Wirth, Executive Vice President – Downstream and Chemicals; and Jeff Gustavson,
General Manager, Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's Website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on slide 2.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. Financially it was another solid quarter. The company's
third quarter earnings were $5.3 billion or $2.69 per diluted share. Current quarter earnings are down about 30%
compared to both second quarter 2012 and to third quarter 2011. It is important to note that both comparative
periods, second quarter this year and third quarter last year, are among the strongest quarters we've ever had.
It is also important to note, as you will see in the remainder of the presentation, that a number of items negatively
affect our third quarter comparisons including swings in foreign exchange and timing effects in the downstream
as well as timing of asset sale gains and other transactions. Year-to-date, earnings were down about 13% versus
2011 which was a record earnings year.
Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 17.4%, and our debt ratio at the end of September was
8.5%. In the third quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the fourth quarter, we expect to
repurchase the same amount.
Turning to Slide 4, cash generated from operations was almost $8 billion during the quarter bringing our year-todate operating cash flow to just over $26 billion which is net of about $2 billion build in inventory.
At quarter end, our cash balances were approximately $21 billion and our net cash position was approximately 9
billion. We've had the right strategies and executed well against them. This has led to excellent financial
performance, strong cash generation and total shareholder returns that lead the peer group.
Jeff will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager, Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Pat.
Turning to slide 5, I'll compare results of the third quarter 2012 with the second quarter 2012. As a reminder, our
earnings release compares third quarter 2012 with the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter earnings were $5.3
billion, a decrease of approximately $2 billion from second quarter results. Overall, foreign exchange movements
accounted for about 25% of this decline. We moved from a net positive foreign exchange position in second
quarter of almost $200 million to a net negative position of nearly $300 million in the third quarter.
Upstream earnings were down $481 million on unfavorable foreign exchange effects and lower production partly
offset by a gain on an asset sale. Downstream results decreased by approximately $1.2 billion, between quarters
driven primarily by unfavorable inventory valuation effects, lower volumes and lower realized margins. The
variance in the Other bar reflects higher corporate charges and an unfavorable swing in corporate tax items.
On slide 6, our U.S. upstream earnings for the third quarter were $196 million lower than second quarter's results.
Lower realizations reduced earnings by $140 million. Although key benchmark crude spot prices were roughly flat
between quarters, Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realizations decreased 6% due to the monthly lag on pricing for
most of our Gulf of Mexico volumes. This was partly offset by a 21% increase in natural gas realizations between
periods. Lower production volumes, primarily due to disruptions from Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico,
decreased earnings by $85 million between periods.
The Other bar reflects a number of items including an increase in operating expenses related to higher
maintenance and other production-related activities, as well as lower exploration expenses during the quarter.
Turning to slide 7, international upstream earnings were $285 million lower than the second quarter. An
unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $470 million. The third quarter had foreign
exchange losses of approximately $250 million compared to gains of $220 million during the second quarter. As a
reminder, these are primarily balance sheet translation effects.
Lower liftings, primarily due to planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan and the U.K., decreased earnings by $235
million. The gain from the previously announced sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone LNG project
increased earnings by about $600 million. The sale supports our strategies and growth plans for LNG in the
region expanding our existing partnership with Tokyo Electric who have committed to total LNG offtake of 4.2
million tonnes per year from the Wheatstone project.
The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including higher DD&A as well as higher operating expenses
largely associated with turnaround activity.
Slide 8 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production
decreased 108,000 barrels per day between quarters. We had previously indicated that the third quarter would
include higher turnaround and maintenance activity and it did.
Planned turnaround activities, primarily in Kazakhstan and the U.K., decreased production by 78,000 barrels per
day. The Second Generation Plant, or SGP, turnaround at TengizChevrOil, or TCO, started the first of August and
lasted approximately six weeks. This was the first ever turnaround for this facility and was one of the largest
turnarounds Chevron has every executed.
Annual maintenance at TCO's Sour Gas Injection, or SGI, facility was conducted simultaneously with the SGP
turnaround to maximize efficiency and limit production down time. More than 6,500 employees and contractors
were involved and more than 2.6 million man hours were worked. Gas and crude were reintroduced into the units
in mid-September and production was safely restored. TCO's facilities are currently producing at full capacity.
While of a smaller impact, turnarounds in the North Sea at Captain, Britannia and Jade also hurt production this
quarter. Production has been restored here as well.
The next bar relates to weather. Weather impacts, primarily Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico decreased
production by 23,000 barrels per day. The Base Business bar is largely related to the change in our normal field
decline rate between periods which was essentially flat between quarters. The last bar shows production from
recent major capital project start-ups which decreased by 5,000 barrels per day compared to the second quarter.
We expect production in the fourth quarter to be higher than in the third quarter as production is restored
following the weather and maintenance related down times I just described.
For the full year, we expect to come in somewhere around 97% of our original target. You will recall our original
target was 2.68 million barrels of oil equivalent production per day. The shortfall was driven primarily by the
precautionary shutdown of the Frade Field earlier in the year and delayed start-up at Angola LNG. Next let's move
to downstream.
Turning to Slide 9, U.S. downstream earnings decreased $346 million in the third quarter. Lower margins
decreased earnings by $20 million driven by significantly weaker marketing margins which were only partly offset
by stronger refining margins. West Coast marketing margins fell more than 40% during the third quarter while
product tightness in the West Coast and export demand in the Gulf Coast lifted refining margins modestly.
Overall, the August fire at our Richmond refinery crude unit had little earnings impact for the quarter. The
Richmond crude unit is expected to remain offline through the fourth quarter with restart currently planned for
the first quarter of next year. Other units in the refinery continue to operate, although at reduced rates.

Lower volumes decreased earnings by $125 million primarily related to our Richmond refinery operating at a
reduced rate as well as a slowdown at the Pascagoula refinery due to Hurricane Isaac. Timing effects represented a
$180 million negative earnings variance between quarters driven by the revaluation of inventory and mark-tomarket effects on derivatives tied to underlying physical positions. The swing between quarters was primarily
driven by rising crude and product prices during the third quarter, compared to sharply falling prices during the
second quarter. The Other bar consists of several unrelated items.
On slide 10, International downstream earnings were $936 million lower this quarter. Lower realized margins
contributed $125 million to the decline. Better crack spreads in Asia were more than offset by falling marketing
margins and pricing lag effects for sales of naphtha and jet fuel in key markets. An unfavorable swing in timing
effects, mostly attributable to inventory revaluation, decreased earnings by $340 million. Falling prices in the
second quarter resulted in a $190 million gain whereas rising prices in the third quarter resulted in a $150 million
loss.
The net earnings impact for the year related to timing is negligible as compared to year-to-date earnings of
approximately $1.7 billion in the International downstream segment. Lower gains on asset transactions as well as
charges associated with portfolio restructuring in Australia negatively affected the quarter-to-quarter comparison
by $245 million and $100 million respectively. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including lower
shipping results and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange effects.
Slide 11 covers All Other. Third quarter net charges were $575 million, an increase of $284 million between
periods. An unfavorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $134 million decrease to earnings. Corporate
charges were $150 million higher in the third quarter. Year-to-date, corporate charges were $1.4 billion which is
higher than our quarterly guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. However, we currently expect fourth
quarter corporate charges to be in line with this guidance.
Mike is now going to provide an update on our downstream operations. Mike?

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Jeff. I know many of you on the line are in New York and have had a pretty tough week. So I hope your
families are safe and that things get back to normal as soon as possible for you.
Moving to Downstream and Chemicals, overall it's been another good year so far. We continue to deliver on the
commitments we've made and our results back that up. Turning to Slide 13, I'll start with financial performance.
Through three quarters we've earned $3.4 billion. This translates to downstream unit earnings adjusted to exclude
special items of $3.10 per barrel. Which ranks a close second year-to-date based on competitor earnings
announcements earlier this week.
Year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for the full Downstream and Chemicals segment is 18.6% which
also ranks number two among our peers. Our relative competitive performance on these two measures has
steadily improved over 2010 and 2011 and continues to remain strong in 2012.
We've got the right strategies and are keenly focused on execution. I'm confident we'll continue to further improve
in the quarters to come.
Moving to slide 14, here's an update on portfolio actions and the milestones we've achieved this year. We've exited
eight countries in the Caribbean islands. We've also completed several asset divestments including our interests in
the Alberta Envirofuels isooctane plant in Canada, the fuels terminal and former refinery at Perth Amboy, New
Jersey, fuels marketing in Spain and certain businesses of GS Caltex in Korea. And we've recently begun reviewing
bids for our fuels businesses in Egypt and Pakistan.
We continue to place emphasis on core markets. We've simplified our model. We've reduced costs while returning
scale where we have competitive positions. All designed to deliver stronger returns. Our focus is on value not
volume.
Now let's move to slide 15. Here's an update on our major capital projects starting with Chevron Phillips Chemical.
Already a leader in the production of normal alpha olefins, CP Chem is constructing the world's largest onpurpose 1-hexene plant at Cedar Bayou, Texas expected to start up in 2014.
CP Chem continues to make good progress in developing a new world-scale ethylene cracker at Cedar Bayou and
new polyethylene units at Sweeny. Start-up of these plants is expected in 2017 with attractive NGL supply
underpinning this new capacity.
And CP Chem's Saudi joint venture, Saudi Polymers Company, began commercial production last month at their
new olefins and derivatives facility in Al Jubail. With this start-up, CP Chem becomes the world's largest producer
of high density polyethylene.
Moving to lubricants, construction continues on our Pascagoula base oil plant which remains on track for planned
start-up next year. This will leverage surplus hydrogen capacity and make Chevron the largest premium base oil
supplier in the world.
Our joint venture in Korea, GS Caltex, is building a gas oil cracker which when completed early next year will
make Yeosu the largest processor of heavy oil in Korea. This will provide greater feed stock flexibility and
additional production of high value products.
And our additive company, Oronite, is expanding its manufacturing plant in Singapore. Upon completion of this
project expected in 2014, Oronite will have effectively doubled the original size of what is already the largest
additives plant in the region.
You can see the focus of our investment here, primarily into the more attractive chemicals and lubricants
segments. As these projects are brought online in the coming years they are positioned to generate good returns
and earnings growth.
Moving slide 16, I'd like to close with a few observations on market dynamics this year. We continue to see a lot of
volatility in both crude and product prices as represented here by the WTI-Brent spread and the Gulf Coast
unleaded gasoline price. This volatility not only impacts margins but also creates other effects related to inventory,
derivative, mark-to-market values, etcetera, that move through our books as Jeff discussed earlier.
Interestingly, the peaks and valleys this year have largely coincided with quarter ends which tends to magnify
these effects even though average pricing across the quarters would suggest much less movement. I realize that
these are difficult to anticipate and model, which is why Jeff provided some insight into the direction and
magnitude of these effects in the prior two quarters. I tend to look at our performance on a year-to-date basis or a
rolling multiple quarter basis where these movements tend to reverse or offset themselves.

On slide 17, I've got data over a two month stretch of time for the U.S. West Coast. The West Coast market – West
Coast gasoline market in particular, is somewhat unique in that it's relatively isolated from the world market by
geography, logistics and product specification.
When the West Coast refineries are all operating normally, product supply is adequate to meet demand. In fact,
given the demand declines of recent years we even tend to see some capacity to export. However, when supplies
move to the low end of their historical range for whatever reason the price typically moves up. This reflects the
higher cost of resupply due to both specification and logistical hurdles and the uncertainty on timing of resupply.
This happened earlier this year and again last month when some capacity went offline due to power interruptions
at a time when inventories had already been declining. The move up in prices was sharp until the market
recognized that the capacity would come back online and supplies would rebuild.
I note this because California has embarked on a path of even greater isolation from world fuel markets with its
greenhouse gas regulations. The industry is facing requirements to source blend stocks like Brazilian ethanol from
relatively small and distant sources or to blend in nonexistent stocks like cellulosic biofuels. The pressure on an
already high cost supply chain and potential for further refinery rationalization is only likely to further increase
the price premium California consumers pay and also the likelihood of price spikes like we've seen this year.
Chevron has two of the three largest refineries on the West Coast, with good feedstock and product flexibility. We
have the leading retail market share. We've been in California for more than 100 years. We understand these
markets and are positioned to compete well through a period of change and uncertainty.
That concludes my remarks, and now I'd like to turn it back over to Pat.

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

All right. Thanks, Mike. Turning now to slide 18, I'd like to focus on recent upstream developments and strategic
progress. On the exploration front, we announced further drilling in the greater Gorgon area with the Satyr-2 and
Satyr-4 wells, our 15th and 16th discoveries in Australia since mid-2009. These new discoveries highlight the
quality of Chevron's exploration capabilities and the continued growth of our vast natural gas resource base in the
Carnarvon basin. On a related note, I want to point out that the picture that you see on this slide, we have now
successfully raised the roof on the second LNG tank at Gorgon.
We also made new additions to our worldwide exploration portfolio having been awarded participation in two
deepwater blocks located offshore Sierra Leone. We have a significant presence in this region already and are
pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the Republic of Sierra Leone's promising deepwater exploration
efforts.
We sanctioned the Lianzi project located in the unitized offshore zone between Angola and the Republic of Congo.
It is the first cross-border development in the region and builds on Chevron's strong position in West Africa.
We acquired additional interest in the Clio and Acme fields through an exchange which was announced in August.
This exchange is strategic and fits nicely with our long-term plans to grow our Australian resource base and create
expansion opportunities for the Wheatstone project.
Also of note this quarter, we completed the previously announced sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone
project to Tokyo Electric.

And finally as recently announced we acquired an additional 246,000 net acres in the Permian basin. This new
acreage plus our existing acreage gives us a net leasehold position of about 1.5 million acres. I'd like to say a bit
more about this acquisition and our overall position and plans in the Permian.
Turning to slide 19, this slide shows our significant acreage position both within and adjacent to the Permian
basin shown in dark green on the chart. The map on the chart shows our existing lease positions in yellow as well
as the recently acquired acreage in light blue.
The new acreage strategically complements our existing operations and provides us with additional growth
potential in the Permian. The Permian extends from West Texas into the Southeast New Mexico and includes
several component basins including the Midland and Delaware basins. Chevron is one of the largest hydrocarbon
producers in the Permian with approximately 114,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day production during 2011.
We have over 550,000 net acres in the Midland basin. Our current focus areas include the Wolfcamp, Cline and
Atoka Shale and we are on pace to drill, ourselves and with partners, over 300 wells in 2012.
In the highly prospective Delaware Basin where most of the recently acquired acreage resides, our near-term focus
will be on the Bone Springs formation as well as the Avalon and Wolfcamp shales. We are on pace to drill 12
operated wells during 2012 as well as 16 non-operated wells.
The acquisition has also provided us access to additional people and resources to execute our base business and
growth strategy in the area. While our production in the basin dates back to the 1920s, our existing and recently
acquired acreage hold significant future potential as these are early in life, liquids-rich unconventional assets in a
premiere emerging play. We plan to provide greater detail on our plans in this area at our security analyst meeting
this coming March in New York City.
Turning now to slide 20, I'd like to close my prepared remarks with a few key points. 2012 is all about execution
and we're doing well. We continued to progress our major capital projects both upstream and downstream. We are
over 50 complete on Gorgon. Our Wheatstone project is also progressing well. I encourage you to follow our
progress and to view some recent Gorgon and Wheatstone flyover videos and presentations which are now
available on our website.
Our two key deepwater Gulf of Mexico major capital projects, Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot, continue to be on
schedule. We remain confident we are on track to hit our longer term target of 3.3 million barrels of oil equivalent
production per day by 2017. This volume growth combined with industry leading upstream margins which were
$23.88 per barrel year-to-date is a large part of the Chevron value proposition for investors.
Another strong and growing element of value for investors has been our distributions to shareholders. We're
currently paying out about $12 billion annually through dividends and share repurchases and we offer an
attractive 3.2% yield.
Now this concludes our prepared remarks and we'd now like to take your questions. We do have a full queue so
please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to see that we get your
questions answered.
Shawn, please open the lines.

Q

Hey. Morning, everybody, and thanks as always for the additional information. It's helpful. Maybe first question
for Pat, I know it may be premature but I know last year Chevron made a competitive dividend raise and with
CapEx likely higher in 2013, how do you think about drawing on the large net cash balance to continue to drive the
superior and competitive dividend yield as you've really bridged to the production growth and harvesting the
capital investment that you're making now and in 2014 and beyond? And I have a follow-up, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay, Evan. I think it's a good question, but frankly, I think you've outlined our philosophy there just in asking the
question.
We do pay attention to and want to remain highly competitive on our dividend stream and that's why you have
seen us over the last several years grow the dividend rate at – very aggressively – 11% compounded per year. As we
look forward we want to continue that pattern. We obviously do see once we get into the high growth periods and
the major capital projects come online we do see significant cash generation coming forward there.
We take that into account. We take a look at what our investment profile needs to be between now and then and
all of those factors get brought into the mix. Our view of medium term commodity prices get bought into the mix.
It's based on all of those factors that we then go forward and have a discussion with our board about our dividend
policy.
I think it's very safe to say that our board takes our dividend responsibilities very seriously and our desire to
remain competitive and grow that stream of income for our investors is a high priority item. In fact it's the single
highest priority of cash use.

Q

That's helpful. If I could have a follow up to take advantage of Mike being on the call. Mike, I know you you've
talked about positive trends in the base oil business in the past and you're increasing your premium base oil
capacity at Pascagoula. As generally a less transparent business in general, maybe just give us an overview of just
that U.S. market, your returns, expectations for this $1.4 billion expansion and whether or not there's any
additional base oil expansion potential at places like Salt Lake where I know there's also a local high paraffinic
crude source? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, so it is a market that is a little less transparent, a little less well understood. In broad terms, the largest
portion of the current base oil is a lower technology product called Group 1 which is made through a relatively
simple process of solvent de-waxing. That is a lower performing product and ultimately as we see, specifications
evolve to higher performance standards and engines evolve to meet more stringent environmental regulations.
You're seeing the OEMs migrate to a higher quality lubricant which is the Group 2+ or premium base oils which
are made through a hydro processing technology which Chevron actually is one of the two primary licensors in the
world for and we have some distinct technology advantages there.
So it's – the Group 2 or the premium base oil market is a higher margin market. And it is the rapidly growing
market as the Group 1 market declines in demand. So you've got absolute demand growth for lubricants. And
within that, you've got Group 1, which is the larger portion today, shrinking in size and so the premium market is
growing quite rapidly with the higher margins.
So that's the broad context for that. We've got a large facility at Richmond right now that manufactures premium
base oils. With Pascagoula we'll move past Shell to be the largest in the world and that product will go not only
into the U.S. market, but Europe is a large market and has a very high specification standard. There's growth in
Latin America. So Pascagoula will feed markets well beyond North America and actually allow us to rebalance
some of the Richmond barrels into the growth of markets in Asia.
We do have reviews underway for additional investments in that sector. They likely would be in Asia rather than in
Salt Lake City because of the proximity to the markets and some of our existing refining infrastructure that we
have in Asia. While you might have an advantaged feed stock that you can use at Salt Lake City, the volumes there
would be relatively small. The logistics disadvantage to get it to the large growth markets would be non-trivial. So
I wouldn't expect to see something happen at Salt Lake City but you certainly could expect to hear more in the
future about potential projects in Asia.

The returns would be well higher than what we typically get out of our refining projects. And we expect returns on
these kinds of projects to be up in the 20%-ish range.

Q

Yes. Thanks, everyone. I guess while we've got Mike on the phone, some downstream questions. Just an update on
Richmond?

A

Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, so, Richmond, as Jeff mentioned, the crude unit remains offline today and will remain offline through the
balance of the fourth quarter with an expected start-up in the first quarter of next year. We're working closely with
outside investigators as well as conducting our own investigation to determine the root cause of the incident and
then to share the learnings of that, not only broadly within our own organization, but also across the industry to
try to prevent similar things from happening anywhere.
The preliminary results of our investigation have identified a damage mechanism known as high temperature
sulfidation corrosion which led to a general thinning of the piping component that failed. We're waiting for
definitive metallurgical testing to confirm that, but it is strongly suspected that that is the technical mechanism.
The questions as to why that corrosion had not been identified and addressed are really still the focus of our
investigation.
We're working closely with multiple agencies in the city, the county and the regional air quality district to expedite
the permitting process and affect the repairs to the crude unit. That work is well underway. Long lead items have
been ordered and some have already arrived. The work is underway to thoroughly inspect every component within
the crude unit and complete the repairs. With, as I said, an expected restart in the first quarter of next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ed G. Westlake
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Q

Thanks for that, Mike. And then just switching to chemicals. Obviously you've got the big ethane cracker, you've
got the hexane-1 plant. Global demand for chemicals is still going to grow but the Middle East is maybe a little bit
short on low cost gas. When you're thinking about participating in global growth – just maybe a philosophical
question – are there other opportunities for you to continue to deploy capital beyond that ethane cracker or is it
better to just hold with what you have and focus on free cash generation for the corporation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, it's a good question. It's one that we spend time on with CP Chem and certainly at the board there where our
partner participates. We are, I think, pretty well aligned that we would look for other attractive opportunities. CP
Chem's real strengths have been in the olefins and polyolefins chain. It's underpinned by attractive feedstock in
the Middle East as you mentioned and also the position they have in the U.S. which is highly leveraged to NGL
cracking as opposed to naphtha cracking.
So the keys in that business are scale, cost efficiency and good feedstock pricing. I think the big opportunities
continue to be in the Middle East and North America, although you can't ignore Asia given the size of the market
and the demand growth that you see over there, but some of the feed opportunities are not the same in Asia.
So we are supportive of growth beyond the ethane cracker if we can find a project that has the characteristics that
have underpinned the success of CP Chem's investments here in recent years. And we continue to look for those
and while they may not be easy in the Middle East or North America for that matter I don't think they're
impossible. So we continue to look for further opportunities but we wouldn't support projects that are not strong
in their underlying fundamentals for the sake of growth.

Q

I also have a couple questions for Mike. First I wanted to see if there was an update on the $1 billion return
enhancement plan for 2012 meaning what progress has been made on the operating expense and margin
improvement categories? And also you guys have been – had continuous improvement over the last several years I
think as you mentioned a minute ago. Are new programs possible for 2013?
And then second, the plan to close the Sydney refinery should reduce the losses at Caltex in refining and while I
realize that the Brisbane plant's advantaged from a yield perspective, is it clear that it's advantaged enough given
the scale of some of the new plants that coming up in the region or are there other strategic reasons to keep that
plant open? So two questions.

Michael K. Wirth

Okay. On the $1 billion improvement target that we had set for our refining system, I will tell you that we are well
on our way to meeting that. In fact, that was measured against an 2008 baseline and that was a multiyear
program. And as we began this year we were closing in on the $1 billion. I can tell you that we are very, very close
to that and I fully anticipate as we close this year we will have more than met the commitment there.
The extension of the improvement efforts that we've seen over the recent years I would tell you are really going be
in the area of continual improvement on margin – self-created margin improvements and continued focus on cost.
The big things that we've done in the portfolio are largely behind us. I mentioned a number of those today and
we're closing out some pieces of that. The large restructuring of our organization is behind us. We're managing to
hold that in terms of head count and cost, very steady and not seeing erosion of those benefits and now I think the
future improvements will come in the form of steady regular expectations for continual improvement on both the
margin and the cost side within the business as opposed to the big transformational effort that you saw over the
last few years. And I think we have every reason to believe that we can continue to grind out further improvements
in that arena.
The other thing that will drive financial performance will be some of the investments I talked about which will add
strong returns and good earnings growth. So we intend to continue to improve the financial performance of the
business.
On Australia, the Kurnell closure was announced. And you mentioned the plant at Lytton which is in Brisbane.
The decisions on those assets are made by the board of Caltex Australia which is 50% owned by Chevron and 50%
publicly traded. So really comments on the future of that particular asset are best addressed to them through their
IR group. I think they've made some public statements about Brisbane.

Q

Thank you. Just another CP Chem question. When that joint venture was formed I think it was originally with
Phillips Petroleum over 10 years ago, I mean the outlook for U.S. chemicals and chemicals itself was very
different. It was more about cost cutting, rationalization and you've been very successful with that. As the business
shifts towards potentially being more of a growth mode, are you still comfortable with the 50/50 joint venture? I
know you've been very aligned with all the successor companies, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66, but is that still
the right structure for this asset? Are there better or other ways to optimize value? Is there a requirement for it to
generate free cash flow or would you be willing for this asset to take in cash if there were more attractive
investment opportunities? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, you're a good student of the history there Arjun. It real did start out in a pretty tough environment
particularly in North America. The first decade or large part of it was characterized by cost reductions and
essentially a fix it or exit approach to a number of the businesses that had been struggling to perform. And that's
been a very successful strategy. The latter part of the last decade, we began to see some of these new projects
particularly the Middle East come on. And those have been quite successful. Now we find a portfolio in North
America that's well positioned relative to NGL feedstock. So it's been a very successful venture, I think, for both
shareholders and, as you mentioned, we've stayed quite well aligned with our partners even as they've gone
through some changes in ownership from Phillips to ConocoPhillips and now Phillips 66. Both companies injected
not only their assets but really their human capability in the chemical sector into that business and I think we've
been well served by that.
I don't have any particular reason to believe that the structure we've got right now won't continue to be successful
for us. We have, CP Chem has actually paid down their debt and so we've not asked for cash to come back to the
shareholders but rather asked for them to pay down the debt and they have substantial cash generation capability
today which will self-fund all the projects that we see on the drawing board for them for the foreseeable future.
And I think we would deal with – if there were attractive opportunities to invest in that business that required us
to bring cash into the entity, there's no reason why we wouldn't do that.

Q

That's very helpful Mike. And maybe just a related follow-up. You've obviously got a massive Marcellus position in
the Utica potentially as well. Do the economics of a cracker in that area make sense to you? Or is it more logical for
the gas to get shipped to the Gulf Coast and get processed there than to a potential cracker.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, it's a really interesting question. And I think there are some different opinions out there on that, Arjun. The
plus on the Marcellus and potentially Utica is obviously the high volumes of gas liquids that we could see in that
area. What is lacking is the infrastructure. So the frac plants, the logistics and the ability to support a cracker with
the midstream assets that are so plentiful and well developed down in the Gulf Coast.
So I think it remains an open question as to whether or not enough of that midstream supporting infrastructure
will really emerge that would give you the reliable supply and the ability to operate a world scale cracker on a
highly competitive and reliable basis or not. Somebody's going have to build out some of that infrastructure and
there's certainly some of that activity underway. But the Gulf Coast is a clearly got that in abundance and to the
extent you can transport the gas liquids to Mount Belvieu and into that infrastructure that is a real advantage.
And so at this point that's certainly where we've chosen to place our bet on the belief that that infrastructure's
mature and in place. And I think we'll just have to wait and see how the future unfolds for potential investments
up in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, etcetera.

Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I have one for Pat and one for Mike, please. Pat, just quickly on the CapEx. It
looks like we're running a little light versus the budget for the year. Can you just give us an update? Do you expect

Doug, if you look at our pattern over the last several years – first quarter, second quarter, third quarter and then
fourth quarter – we typically are back end loaded in terms of the expenditure profile. But if you look at 2012 and
how that pattern has unfolded relative to the pattern in 2011, the pattern in 2010, the pattern in 2009, etcetera it's
exactly per a typical approach for us. So yeah, I think the answer is we will be back end loaded but it's nothing that
is unanticipated or not expected.

Q

Okay. Thanks for that. Mike, this one's a double edge question I guess. But Richmond obviously has had its issues
in the past and the commentary you made in your prepared remarks regarding California – we've seen a couple of
your competitors talk about whether strategically California makes sense for them going forward given the
amount of capital that could be required on a cost basis and so on. I'm just curious as to whether you would ever
consider either – exiting I guess is unlikely, but doing something different with those assets or to go completely
another direction if there were opportunities to maybe consolidate the West Coast and maybe reap some synergies
it could offset some additional costs. I'm wondering strategically how you view your position on downstream on
the West Coast, whether it's core or not? And I'll leave it at that. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. Well, I'll start out with the fact that it is core. It has been – it's where our downstream business began. It's
where, as I said, we've been here for 110 years. It's one of the largest markets for fuels in the world and we've
weathered the good times and the difficult times here and we've seen the cycles.
The – the second part of your question, would we consider some sort of a consolidation? I'll tell you that's pretty
difficult to do from the standpoint of market concentration. We've got – as I said we've got two of three largest
refineries on the West Coast today and I'm not sure it's practical that we would be able to acquire another refining
asset and get that through all the approval processes. So unless something changes externally, I'm not sure that's a
realistic scenario.
We do look at alternate configurations. We look at alternate modes of operation. We're pretty circumspect about
capital investments into a market as this overhang of regulatory uncertainty that exists today. But it has been a
very good business for us. A couple of key attributes: our refineries sit very high in the competitive stack on
complexity and net cash margin. So they're not only large but they are able to take in a variety of feedstocks, they
make a good slate of high value products and relative to our competition they generate margins that sit at the very
top. So they're big and they're more profitable than the competition.
El Segundo in particular also is well integrated into our upstream business. We run a lot of San Joaquin Valley
heavy crude at El Segundo and in fact a number of projects in recent years have allowed us to bring more of that
into El Segundo. There are benefits that not only accrue in the downstream but also accrue in the upstream. So it's
a core position. It's a highly competitive position. We have weathered the cycles here and would believe that we
can make a go of it here if anybody can because we know these markets and we've been through the cycles.
The uncertainty that you referred to and I know – I've heard some of the others in the industry talk about it,
California has a go-it-alone plan on greenhouse gas initiatives. And it will further deteriorate what is already a
weak economy and it will make no meaningful impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. There will be a
negative impact on jobs, on consumers and by design and by intent, AB 32 and the low carbon fuel standard will
raise fuel prices and further isolate this market from the rest of the world.
So it runs the risk of disadvantaging California businesses by imposing higher costs that aren't borne by out-ofstate competitors and the policy is one that we have real questions about. So we're working with a variety of
stakeholders to make sure that the additional costs and market risks are well understood and transparent. Not
only understood by the government and regulators but also consumers and businesses and we think they need to
understand what we're headed into.
And at the same time we're working on our own plans for how to operate and compete in a world where those
regulations come into effect and how we can continue to be the strongest competitor in that market. So it's not
simple or straightforward and there are some uncertainties. But we believe we can compete better than anybody in
that environment.

Q

Thank you. Good morning. I just had a couple, two upstream questions. On Kazakhstan and specifically TCO, can
you just give us an idea where we are in the cycle of the turnarounds? Because I know this year was a significant
turnaround, one of the largest you said in the history of the plant. And I just think last year there may have been
some down time too. So I'm struggling to understand a little bit the cycle of these turnarounds and how large they
can be because it had a very large impact on production.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

The turnarounds that we had this time of SGI really was the first time that we have had a significant turnaround in
over the five-year period of time. But there can be intermittent, once a year KTL train downtimes that are just a
normal part of the maintenance program. This was a very significant turnaround. It's not expected to have this
kind of an impact in successive years here until there's a next big turn around five years from now, but you can get
individual KTL trains that go down per year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. Fair enough. And then can you give us an update on Angola LNG? I may have missed your prepared

production.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. I mean, we are still going through kind of the startup process for the plant. We have had some startup
problems. And we're not anticipating at this point that there will be significant production from ALNG in 2012.
It's not unusual to have startup problems as you're going through the commissioning effort. Admittedly we had a
little bit more problems this time than we would have typically expected. But we do look for ALNG production,
first LNG to be with us in the first quarter of 2013.

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

My two quick questions. On slide 10, when you're looking at sequentially to the second quarter in International
Refining, the margin is down $125 million. Can you tell us – I must be missing something because all the
benchmark indicator I track, whether it's in Singapore, Japan, there seems to have sequentially up from the
second quarter and all your competitors seems to have that. So is there any particular market that have seen a
down margin environment? Or is there any particular product that's important to you that have seen that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, so let me – it is a little counterintuitive, Paul. If you look at the Dubai 3-1-1 which is a pretty good proxy for
Asian refining margins, the 1-1-1 is gasoline, diesel and fuel oil. It doesn't include naphtha or LPG, both of which
have been hammered really hard in the marketplace. So the realized refining margin that you would expect out of
3-1-1 isn't actually as strong as – what you get isn't as strong as what you would expect because you get the
naphtha and LPG. A couple of our refineries, our GS Caltex and our Singapore refinery – large and they make a
fair amount of both of those products. There's also some crude lags in a couple of those affiliates that can squeeze
their margins that you wouldn't see in the 3-1-1. So there's a piece of it where the capture on that is not as strong
as the indicator.
The other thing that's not as transparent, I think, if you're looking at that indicators as we see in our actuals, are
the marketing margins. And marketing margins are down in general in a rising market. In particular our large
position in Korea has been squeezed by the government and some government intervention in that market and
more so than in other markets and so we've definitely seen some under-realization of what we would like to see in
marketing margins in Korea.
And then we have lagged pricing on a number of our products in marketing. So jet and naphtha both get sold on a
prior month basis and in a rising market those prices were weak anyway. And now you're selling on a prior month
so you're selling even at a lower value relative to current in a rising market. So there's a number of components
like that, that are not apparent in a headline refining crack indicator. All of which in this market that we've seen in
the third quarter we've gone in the opposite direction of the stronger refining margin.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Senior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Okay. The second question is that I think on the – I think a lot of people that has been looking at using railroad
that may be a relatively near term and effective way to ship the discount crude to their refining operation. Can you
maybe help us to understand if there's any active or major initiatives that you guys is contemplating or is currently
taking to ship those discount crudes to your, say, three coastal refinery or that the opportunity set is not really
there for California at all?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, it is – it's certainly something that we look at. We've run Bakken crude on the West Coast already. We've run
Eagle Ford at Pascagoula. Not in large volumes but we do understand the logistics to get those discounted crudes
into our big coastal refineries. As you say, on this crude disconnect, it's like real estate: it's location, location,
location and our large coastal refineries are distant from where these advantages really are.
You can get Bakken crude up into the Pacific Northwest via rail. You then have the challenge of how to get it down
to the West Coast you can do that with barge, you can do it with further rail. And so you've got transshipment
costs and then you've got to have the offloading capability in your refineries and our refineries really weren't set
up for large rail based receipts of crudes.
So the logistics are tough into the coastal refineries. They're very good into a couple of our smaller refineries. So
our refinery in British Columbia and our refinery in Salt Lake City have pipeline connections to discounted crudes
and have been able to take full advantage of that. So we have seen some of our assets that have benefited.
The other thing I would just remind you on the big coastal refineries, Paul, is they have other advantages that
they've historically had which they continue to capture. Relative to our lightering on the West Coast and some
advantages we have there. Pascagoula runs some discounted Latin American grades and has a lot of flexibility to
bring those in. And so you're constantly optimizing the crude slate on your landed cost of crude via rail or versus
these other modalities. And so that's a part of the normal business. We're certainly doing everything we can to
take advantage of the discontinued crudes in those refineries but the opportunities get chewed up a lot in the
transportation.

Jason D. Gammel
Analyst, Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.

Q

Thank you. At the risk of exasperating Mike on the California issues, Mike, have you done any or do you have any
estimates on what the potential incremental cost is going be from complying with the greenhouse emissions. And I
guess I'm thinking of terms of any environmental CapEx that you have put into the business and any uplift in
operating expense although recognizing you might be able to pass it on to the consumer. And then I guess really
what I'm leading to, do you get to a situation where you may be better off sourcing CARBOB outside of California
and then just shipping it to your refineries?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, there's a wide range of potential incremental costs, Jason. And the reality is our refineries are amongst the
most energy efficient refineries in the world. And our stationary source emissions are very, very low. The
opportunity to spend further capital to mitigate stack emissions of CO2 are – they're just about tapped out. So
your choices are going to the market to buy credits and that could be something that we'll see where the market
price goes on that. But we really don't have a lot of opportunity other than cutting runs and restricting supply. And
there are some who believe that is the ultimate way that we'll see people comply is just reducing their [ph] crude
cooks (1:00:00) which tightens up the market which runs the price risk.
If you get fuels under the cap and trade, which is anticipated out towards the middle of this decade, the costs
explode and that's where you go from costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars a year to costs in the billions of
dollars a year. And frankly all of this stuff has got to go through to the market. We can not absorb it and I don't
intend to absorb it. And so the expectation is that as we see hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of increased
costs, that translates through into the price of the product. And that was the basis for my comment earlier that
California's consumers will continue to pay a higher premium than the rest of the country. And that is the policy
path that we are on.
The issue of CARBOB imports is one that we're very sensitive to, because if those imports are not subject to some
of the same obligations that manufacturers are, then you've got a competitive disadvantage. And that's a subject of
discussion with the regulators and if in fact it were more economic to import than to manufacture here then that's
very well what we could do. That's got real implications for jobs and investment. So it's still an evolving and
uncertain environment. And frankly we're trying to help people understand the implications of these things if it
stays on the track that it's on right now. And the implications are all bad.

Iain S. Reid

Q

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Mike, can I ask you more of a macro question. I've heard one of your competitors
saying yesterday they thought we were close to the bottom of the chemical cycle. I'm not sure whether he was
talking about a naphtha base or ethane base. But can you maybe make a comment on that and also from your
perspective where you think the down street product market is in terms of demand, growth or decline in your
areas of focus, Asia and U.S.?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, I don't know exactly what you heard yesterday. What I would tell you is that the chemicals business has
been good for those that have gas liquids based feeds. And so – and that's mostly what CP Chem has. Naphthabased crackers have been in a pretty tough environment. They're the marginal producer and with high crude oil
prices, naphtha based cracking margins have not been very attractive at all. And so we do continue to see growth
in demand for the derivatives in the polyolefin chain.

So if there's a belief we're at the bottom of the cycle because we've seen market demand growth and perhaps some
improvement in naphtha-based cracking margins, that comes on top of what are already pretty good ethane-based
cracking margins. And so it very well could be the portfolio differences between what we've seen in our portfolio
and what somebody else may see in theirs would account for a different view of the cycle.
The second question on the broader fuels trends and demand, I am a pessimist, to be honest with you. Europe
continues to be a real problem. The recovery in the U.S. is not as, in my view and the things we see through the
people we sell to, not as robust as you might believe if you read the headlines. And I'll give you a couple of other
specific data points more globally.
If I look at our sales of marine lubricants, they have steadily declined for the last several months. If I look at our
sales of base oil, they have steadily declined for the last several months. Our sales of lubricants in Asia have
steadily declined for the last several months. Our sales of additives in Asia have steadily declined for the last
several months. And so we watch these trends pretty carefully because those are sales into industrial sectors,
marine transport is a leading indicator of global economic activity. And you can see destocking and sometimes
there's a fake out where you just see inventories being pulled down and there really isn't an underlying demand
trend.
But what we've seen has gone on for enough months that it causes concerns in my mind about the direction of the
global economy – I think China has definitely been slower than people anticipated. And you don't have the
strength in the other regions of the world as well.
So I continue to believe that refining margins, although this year we've seen a little bit of strength, primarily in the
distillate part of the barrel, I do not believe the fundamentals for stronger refining margins exist out there. We see
more capacity coming online, particularly in China, and I think there are real risks on the demand side of the
equation. So we are not building our plans or banking on maintenance of refining margins that we've seen this
year and certainly not on improvements. I think we have to be prepared for a tough refining margin market out
there for the near to medium term.
