Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome toChevron's second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at thattime. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conferenc e call is being recorded.I will now turn the call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. PatYarrington. Please go ahead.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.Thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with metoday is George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President of Upstream and Gas; and Jeff Gustavson,General Manager for Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and otherforward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on slide two.Slide three provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were $5.4billion, or $2.77 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 16%. Our debt
ratio at the end of June was approximately 12%. In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares.And in the third quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount.Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $8.5 billion during the second quarter and $14.2 billionyear to date. On last quarter's call, I noted adverse working capital effects which reduced first quarter cashgeneration. In the second quarter, we saw some but not complete reversal of these effects. We expect furtherworking capital release as the remainder of the year unfolds.In June, the company executed a $6 billion bond offering, taking advantage of historically low borrowing costs.Capital and exploratory expenditures were $8.6 billion during the second quarter and $16 .8 billion year to date.The year-to-date amount includes incremental resource acquisition outlays associated with Kitimat in Canada,Cooper Basin in Australia, and Kurdistan. George will speak to the value drivers behind these additions a littlelater.At quarter end, our cash balances exceeded $22 billion, giving us a net cash position of approximately $2 billion.As we indicated to you in March and as you saw in the first quarter, the company is moving towards a moretraditional net debt structure.Jeff will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide five, I'll compare results of the second quarter 2013 with the first quarter 2013. As areminder, our earnings release compares second quarter 2013 with the same quarter a year ago.Second quarter earnings were $5.4 billion, about $800 million lower than first quarter results. Upstream earningswere down $967 million, reflecting lower liquids realizations and higher operating expenses associated withincreased maintenance activities, partly offset by a favorable swing in foreign currency effects. Downstreamresults increased $65 million between quarters. The increase was driven by higher downstream volumes followingheavy maintenance during the prior quarter, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses andlower chemicals earnings. The variance in the other bar largely reflects favorable corporate tax items during thequarter.On slide six, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $49 million lower than first quarter's results.Lower realizations decreased earnings by $25 million, driven by a decline in crude oil prices, partially offset by anincrease in natural gas prices. Higher production volumes, primarily from our San Joaquin Valley, California andDelaware Basin, New Mexico operations, increased earnings by $40 million. The other bar reflects a number ofunrelated items, including higher operating expenses related to maintenance and other production relatedactivities as well as slightly higher exploration expenses.Turning to slide seven, international upstream earnings were $918 million lower than the first quarter.Realizations decreased earnings by $550 million. Average liquids unit realizations declined by 8%, in line with thedecrease in average Brent spot prices between quarters. The timing of liftings in Kazakhstan and across multipleother countries decreased earnings by $60 million. Higher operating expenses due to increased maintenanceactivities and the startup of the LNG plant in Angola decreased earnings by $195 million between periods. Afavorable swing in foreign currency effects improved earnings by about $105 million. The second quarter had again of about $275 million compared to a gain of about $17 0 million in the first quarter. The other bar includesthe absence of favorable tax effects during the first quarter and higher exploration expenses.Slide eight summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Productiondecreased 63,000 barrels per day between quarters. Lower prices increased volumes under production sharingand variable royalty contracts during the second quarter by about 5,000 barrels per day. Planned turnaroundactivities in Kazakhstan and Australia had the largest impact, reducing production by 45,000 barrels per day. Thebase business in the other bar includes normal field declines and lower natural gas demand, primarily in Thailand.Turning to slide nine, U.S. downstream earnings were essentially flat between periods. Higher volumes increasedearnings by $245 million, as several refineries came back online during the second quarter following a particularlyheavy maintenance period during the first quarter. Stronger margins increased earnings by $50 million due tolower crude prices as well as tighter product inventories. Operating expenses increased by $180 million, largelydue to higher fuel consumption, transportation, and environmental related ex penses. Lower chemicals resultsreduced earnings by $110 million, primarily due to lower ethylene margins and reduced volumes on planned andunplanned downtime at two separate plants.On slide 10, international downstream earnings improved by $62 million between quarters. Higher volumesincreased earnings by $80 million, primarily on the absence of maintenance activities at the Cape Town, SouthAfrica and Burnaby, Canada refineries. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $50 million, reflectinghigher fuel usage and employee costs. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items, including anunfavorable swing in foreign exchange impacts and weaker refining margins, partially offset by positive inventoryvaluation effects driven by falling prices during the second quarter.Slide 11 covers all other. Second quarter net charges were $350 million compared to $439 million in the firstquarter, a decrease of $89 million between periods. Favorable corporate tax items resulted in a $145 millionbenefit to earnings, while corporate charges were $56 million higher this quarter. In part, higher corporatecharges reflected an asset impairment, as noted in our interim update. Year -to-date net charges in the all-othersegment were $789 million at the end of the second quarter. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $400million to $500 million for the all-other segment is still appropriate going forward.George is now going to provide an update on our upstream operations. George?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp.Thank you, Jeff, and good morning.To begin, I'd like to note the progress of our Jack/St. Malo and Bigfoot projects for the Gulf of Mexico. This photoshows the hulls of both platforms at the yard in Ingleside, Texas. The topside modules and hulls of the projects arecurrently being integrated. Since this photo was taken, additional modules were set on top of the Bigfoot hull,which is pictured on the left. The Jack/St. Malo tow to its lo cation is scheduled for year end. Jack/St. Malo andBigfoot remain on schedule for 2014 startup, and these are important contributors to our 2017 production target,supporting our profitable growth.Now let's take a look at our financial performance on sl ide 13. Our 2013 year-to-date upstream earnings marginwas $23.88 per barrel. Based on first half results for the peer group, we continue to lead the competition by aconsiderable margin. We're almost $6.50 per barrel ahead of our nearest competitor. We've now held this topposition for 14 consecutive quarters. This result flows from the quality of our investment decisions, the strength ofour portfolio, and the strong execution performance of our base business and projects. I'm also very pleased withour upstream return on capital employed, which is almost 20%. I expect this to rank at the top of our peer group.Now I'll cover our 2013 production on slide 14. Production in the first half of the year averaged 2.61 million barrelsa day at an average year-to-date Brent price of $107.50 per barrel. The first half results are near our forecast givenour planned turnaround and maintenance activity. We anticipate an increase in production in the second half ofthe year. Our 2013 production guidance remains unchanged at 2.65 million barrels a day at an average Brent priceof $112 per barrel.I'm pleased that Angola LNG has achieved startup and has now loaded two cargos to date, with another preparingto load. This significant milestone is the result of the hard work of many individuals at Angola and around theworld. For the second half of the year, we anticipate Angola LNG will be ramping up and will be a largecontributor to our production. We plan to load at least 13 cargos by year end. Remember, at peak rates, ALNGshould contribute about 60,000 barrels per day to our production. We will have additional production ramp -upsfrom our other major capital projects, including Usan and Tahiti 2. We restarted Frade in Brazil at the end ofApril, and currently have three production wells online.As seen on the graph, production growth in the second half also comes from our base operations. This includesadditional cost recovery from production sharing contracts, additional production out of the Marcellus, andincreased drilling activity in the Permian. These increases are partially offset by planned turnarounds. Overall in2013, we expect to have a similar level of turnaround activity as we had in 2012 and relatively heavy for both theseyears. We continue to have confidence in meeting our 2017 growth target as we bring on new projects and otherkey developments.We'd like now to update you on the status of a few key projects. Turn to slide 15. Gorgon is now almost 67%complete. Barrow Island construction has achieved major milestones, including the installation of a second gasturbine generator for Train 1. The third of five generators for the site will arrive later this year. Seven majorprocess modules are on their foundations, and now 11 of the 51 modules are on Barrow Island. The remaining tenTrain 1 modules are scheduled for delivery by year end. We also recently completed the installation of the 20 -inchdomestic gas pipeline.The Gorgon team has resolved the logistics challenges they faced earlier. Additional laydown areas on BarrowIsland were established, and material handling has significantly improved. Increased transportation capacity hasallowed the project to exceed material delivery targets. Construction productivity has improved in some key areas,and our team is focused on increasing productivity across the board for Barrow Island construction. Gorgonmodule fabrication is progressing, and we're managing it closely. We also continue to carefully monitor labor costand weather impacts.In the upstream, the first five subsea wellheads were set. We have finished the lower completions of all the Gorgonwells and 50% of the Jansz-Io wells. As one of our key legacy assets with over 200,000 barrels a day of productionnet Chevron share, Gorgon will be a major contributor to our future financial performance.We have posted several updated photos of progress made at both Gorgon and Wheatstone on our investor website,located at Chevron.com, and I'd encourage you to go there and look at them.Next I'll review progress on some of our other key developments. Wheatstone made significant progress in 2013,with the team focused on site infrastructure and upstream fabrication. We now have over 2,200 people onsite atOnslow. The offshore platform fabrication began in South Korea with the erection of the cellar deck. Offshoredredging began for the pipeline. The first phase of the construction village has been completed, and the newrunway at Onslow Airport is nearing completion. The remaining activities for 2013 focus o n site work to preparefor module deliveries in 2014. Wheatstone remains on target for a late 2016 startup.Kitimat marked an important milestone on July 1, with the transfer of operatorship for the LNG plant and thePacific Trail's pipeline development to Chevron. Front-end engineering is progressing on plan. Early earthworkscontinue at the LNG plant site, where a total of 6.5 million cubic yards of earth and rock have to be moved. LNGmarketing activities and engagement with potential foundation custome rs are underway. We are focusing onAsian markets, and aim to have 60% to 7 0% of the LNG volumes under long-term commitment prior to a finalinvestment decision.In mid-July, we entered into an arrangement with YPF to facilitate the development of a secti on of the VacaMuerta shale basin, which has a significant potential for both liquids and gas production. This initial programincludes 100 wells in a specific portion of a 96,000-acre development area. This development provides a newopportunity that we believe will be competitive with other projects in our portfolio. Above -ground risks havelargely been mitigated through government decrees and the financial structure. All in all, we're pleased with thedeal and the opportunity to participate in the development of this world-class resource. The projects that have justbeen reviewed provide legacy growth in production and cash flow.Now I'll provide an update on our exploration activities. Please turn to slide 17 . We have another active year ofexploration, where we are on plan to invest over $3 billion. We are making great progress in our key focus areas ofthe Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, Australia, and North America unconventionals. Outside of those areas, we have amixture of conventional and unconventional exploration, enhanced by key acreage additions. We have drilled orare currently drilling 10 of our 14 planned impact wells for 2013, including the second well in the Kurdistan regionof Iraq, which spud on Wednesday.Now I'll highlight a few areas of new activity for 2013. We're maintaining our emphasis on the Permian portfolio,and we're increasing drilling activity in exploration, appraisal, and development. We've enhanced our position inthe liquid-rich Delaware Basin and are now the largest leaseholder, with significant potential in undevelopedacreage. We drilled our first two wells in the Utica in Ohio and are encouraged by the preliminary results, andwe'll provide more details on this later this year. We've added another block in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, andour plan is to complete and begin testing two wells this year. Our Australian portfolio has increased, with theaddition of acreage in the Cooper Basin tight gas play. Exploration and appraisal wells are in progress. We've alsoacquired new acreage in China, Brazil, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and Morocco.Finally, we just announced an agreement for the acquisition of additional acreage in the liquids -rich region of theKaybob, Duvernay Basin. This complements our existing acreage position, where we have drilled 10 of our 13-wellprogram. Results for these multistage fracs are positive, with significant condensate yields. These portfolioadditions demonstrate how we continue to selectively capture future growth opportunities, remaining focu sed onvalue, adding assets that can sustain our strong financial performance.Now I'll turn it back to Pat.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.Turning to slide 18, George just provided an update on recent upstream activity.Three milestones were met in the quarter in our downstream business. First, the Richmond refinery successfullyrestarted. By quarter end, the refinery was fully operational and running at planned utilization rates. Second, GSCaltex's EOC refinery began commercial operations of the heavy oil upgrading unit, which now makes EOC one ofthe largest heavy oil upgraders in South Korea. This unit came online three months ahead of schedule. Third, ourchemicals joint venture, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, announced plans to expand its ethylene productionat its Sweeny complex in Texas.I'll close by highlighting our continued strong performance on total shareholder return, as shown on this slide. Wecontinue to lead the peer group by a significant margin, which shows we are executing well against the rightstrategies. I would also like to point out the balanced manner in which our returns were achieved. We know theimportance of not only providing returns via a competitive and growing divid end, but also from disciplinedreinvestment in our business to generate future value. We are fully committed to delivering disciplined growthand shareholder value, and our objective is to continue to lead the peer group on total shareholder returns for along time to come.We appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company. And now I'd like to open themicrophones for questions. We do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and a single followupif necessary. We will do our best to see that we get all your questions answered. Sean, please open up the line.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTIONOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.Please go ahead with your question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul B. SankeyAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QYes. Hi, everyone.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AGood morning, Paul................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul B. SankeyAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QGood morning. On the recent acquisition commitments in Argentina, it comes at a time when your CapEx is veryelevated. And additionally, I think there have been some legal issues around the move. Can you just underline forus why you're making a move like that at a time, as I said, when your CapEx is so elevated and where you're goingto have some legal complexities that you probably really don't need? Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. APaul, it always starts back at what's the opportunity set out there and how does it compete in the future. We likethe Vaca Muerta opportunity from a technical point of view. When you look at it technically, this opportunity –much of the shale is in the 1 ,000-foot range of thickness, so it's very attractive that way. We've been in Argentina along period of time, so we understand, I think, Argentina quite well, so we feel comfortable that way. And wealways have within our portfolio some ability to spend o ur money in different ways. We have the ability because ofour large base business programs that we can move some monies around. I go back to the other point would bethat opportunities are there when they are available, and this one is available.On the legal side, I would start off and say first off, we really don't believe there's any legitimate legal claim againstus, so we're pretty confident about that. We think we're in a good position there. Back on the development itself,we see this very much as a staged development over a long period of time. The initial work is 100 wells. Anddepending upon that success, we will move forward from there. We also see Argentina as a country that's got alarge resource potential. We really believe that over a long period of time, they can move from an importer topotentially an exporter of crude. And once again, the time for the opportunity is now.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul B. SankeyAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QOkay, so just if I could ask...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AGo ahead.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul B. SankeyAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QSo I was just going to follow on with I'm referencing that you yourselves have referenced that this is a highintensity period of CapEx with the dual Australian LNG projects [ph] bubble (24:56) simultaneously in yourqueue. Can you talk about your longer-term CapEx and the potential to bring that down, with a view to generatingmore free cash flow, or are you intending to push through to try and grow the company beyond the existing 3.3million barrel of oil equivalent target that you have for 2017 ? Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AFirst, Paul, I'm going to try to disconnec t those two. They're not necessarily totally connected. At our Marchmeeting when we met in New York, we told people that we see our growth beyond 3.3 million barrels of oilequivalent. We did not disclose what that growth would be. It's a little premature to go there, but we do see growthbeyond that. One of the points that we talked about at that time was the growth that we saw that would be comingfrom our future growth projects and the well pressure management project in Tengiz. When we had originallycommitted to our 3.3 million barrel of oil equivalent, about 80,000 barrels a day of our growth to 2017 was relatedto the Tengiz expansion and that project is not going to be online in 2017, so it contributes to significant growth.And remember, the Tengiz project in total will add – expansion will add about 130,000 to 140,000 barrels a day ofnet production for Chevron. So we do see growth beyond 2017. But likewise, we always see some projects that tendto move a little bit to the right, move a little bit later. So we take that money and invest it in other opportunitiesbecause we have a very strong portfolio.I would tell you as we get Gorgon and Wheatstone completed, those investments, we do not have anything as largein our portfolio on a capital expenditure basis as large as those. So from that perspective, we will see some declinein our capital program in a relative sense. But remember, we're also going to be a lot bigger on the barrel side. Wewill have a lot more barrels, so our cash flows will be high. We've got very strong margins, so we've got thatcombination to go forward. So it's a combination of things that move around. But remember, portfolio, a lot ofbarrels, a lot of barrel growth, 25% growth. We're looking at holding our margins, our marg ins which are industryleading. We think we will hold them, so we're going to have cash flow growth and a flattening, and I would call itmore a flattening, of our capital program going forward.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul B. SankeyAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QThanks, George, and thanks all of you. Thanks, George, for taking the time to come on the call.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AOkay. Thanks, Paul. Okay, next one?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC QGood morning, everybody. And, George, thanks for the update on the upstream projects and clear on the free cashflow. My first question is on the Permian. There has clearly been a lot of exciting industry results. You entered theCimarex joint venture. I know you're building a technology center there. Can you quantify at all for us the activityramp or potential organic growth there in the basin and how Chevron is building or expanding its Permiancapabilities to run a bigger organization? And I have a follow-up.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AMaybe I'll start back with what we said in March of this year. We expect to drill over 300 wells in the PermianBasin. In the Midland Basin itself, we see growth in the Delaware Basin. Remember, we added the Chesapeakeacreage in New Mexico to acreage we'd had already had there. This recent Cimar ex deal in the Permian has reallybrought – is bringing together a checkerboard of acreage of ours and Cimarex. Why do we do that? We do that toincrease efficiency and effectiveness of the dollars we spend. We reduce geographic acreage loss, if you will. Wecan drill longer laterals, so it's just a much more efficient way to develop that acreage. As we said in March, we'regoing to see our rig count grow considerably over this period. I don't think we've done anything post -March thatdoesn't fit with the plans that we showed at the March meeting. Our plans are pretty consistent in that growthprofile both in acreage and in barrels. We do expect that our net production to grow towards in the Permian Basininto that 200,000 barrels.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC QBut I didn't know if there was just any color on the technology center that you're building or people addition orjust what investments you're making to build an infrastructure that would support more significant organicgrowth there?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AWe've committed to a tech center there. We are starting a building, a significant building project there, an officeproject. We have purchased land and moving forward with building that. And I would also tell you remember,we've got a big support function for that unit also out of Houston. So I think we're in good shape on what we havein Midland, and we have a strong commitment. We have lots of acreage. And the Midland and the Permian Basin,and the Delaware Basin are long-term assets for us. But I don't really have anything that's new beyond what wepresented in March.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC QThat's fair. If I can have a second just quickly on Gorgon, can you provide any update on cost trends or color sinceyour guidance earlier in the year, or when or what key milestones will trigger any cost update there?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AI would tell you we're always looking at the costs and watching the cost. We review the p roject once every monthfrom my level and John Watson. We both have a project review once a month. We look at progress. We look atcosts. We look at issues. We look at mitigations that our project team are putting in place. And as you know, a bigproject like this, there are always issues that people are solving problems, and our people are very good at that. Imentioned today that we really think we have solved the issue around the logistics. That was important for us.We're not going to know a lot more on cost until we get really much further in. We don't see any major disconnectsat this point. We see, as an example, the first half of the year exchange rates are really pretty close to what weassumed in our plan. The first part of the year, the rates we re higher than parity. The second quarter, they weredown. But for the year, they're pretty close. And now we're seeing a shift in exchange rates that are positive for uswith exchange rates coming down. And we are in a period where we've got major expendi tures in Australia. We'vegot a lot of moving parts there, so we can always tell where we've been a lot better than where everything is going.Any issues, once again, we try to mitigate those as they go. But I don't see anything major on the cost side. It 's stillback to productivity, and I'll emphasize. It's so critical to get productivity on Barrow Island, and it's important forus to have good weather. Weather is an extremely important part of our success there, and we're in a good part ofthe year right now. Between now and December, we're outside of major weather impacts. So we're in a period thatif we get to December, we will know an awful lot more. We're 67% now, and every time you get a little bit closertowards 100%, you can do a lot better forecasting.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC QGreat. Always helpful, George, thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AThank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AThanks, Evan; our next caller?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Our next question comes from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Arjun Narayana MurtiAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. QThank you, my thanks for the E&P update as well; just a follow-up on Kitimat, where you've now had some time tolook at the project. I know the two big pieces are progressing the feed. And I think you mentioned you want to get60% to 7 0% of the deal sold to long-term customers. On that latter point, you now have Exxon with a big projectin the area. I think Shell has got on. I'm sure you don't want to give a bunch of specifics, though we'd certainlywelcome them. But can you at all talk about how it's going in terms of marketing this? I know there's a question asto whether there might be some linkage to Henry Hub. How are you feeling about Kitimat and its position andyour ability to get that gas sold? Thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AFirst off, I'd say I think we have a considerable time lead versus any of the other developments in the BC region.This project has permits in place for export. It has approval and permits in place for the site. We've got most of theagreements for the pipeline route with the First Nations. Matter of fact, I think 15 or 16 of the groups of FirstNations have already agreed, so I think we're in quite a lead on the early part of a project. We've also done a feed, aone-train feed, and we're now moved into a two-train feed to build two trains there. We've been involved in that.So we do have more work on feed, but we're moving quite well on the feed work. So let me go back once again.We're in a great competitive spot on schedule. That should help us a lot in dealing with those that want to buy gas.It puts our project in many ways ahead of others. So for the buyers that need gas sooner, we are in a very positiveposition.We do not plan to have Henry Hub linkage. We expect that the Henry Hub equivalent value will come throughsome equity sell-down. We do plan to have a partner. As buyers, we're going to offer volumes, some volumes andinterest in the plant as a combination. We think that's a big advantage. We frankly think that's better than HenryHub pricing. Henry Hub, like any index, has variability. Variability means it goes up or it can go down. And webelieve that we can get the same or a better situation for a buyer through their participation, equity participationin the Kitimat project. We can do that because the two partners in us and Apache each hold 50%. We hold verystrong working interest in the plant and in the resources. So we have that ability to move that way.So our goal is, of course, to maintain our advantage, first -mover advantage in that, but at the same time, move theproject at the right speed, having done all the appropriate technical work; and once again, having really all thecommercial work done that gets us to a 60% to 7 0% position with regards to sale. We have had some initialdiscussions with Asian buyers. We will not disclose the ones that we're talking with at this time, but we are movingthat forward.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Arjun Narayana MurtiAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. QThat's a very thorough and helpful update, just a very quick fol low-up in terms of the appropriate speed. We'vealways thought of this as more likely to be a 2014 FID versus 2013, which I think at one point had been talkedabout. I don't know if you can comment on that?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AI wouldn't disagree that it's more likely to be a 2014 FID. Once again, we've got to have all the right work done.And what's critical for us, and we're not progressing the project through FID until we have these agreements, atleast at an HOA [Heads of Agreement] level, for 60% to [audio gap] (38:53 – 38:56) that will take us into 2014 toget those completed.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Arjun Narayana MurtiAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.

AThank you, Arjun.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with yourquestion.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Edward G. WestlakeAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QYes, thanks very much for all of the information this morning. Just coming to the offshore, it feels as if with a largeposition in the Permian and some of the LNG projects that you have that the rise in offshore rig rates and subseacosts might mean a shift in the portfolio, so I guess two questions. One is how are you mitigating the rise? Whatare your views on those offshore costs? And how much flexibility do you have to shift capital around to avoid thatinflation? Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AEverything depends upon the economics of the projects in our portfolio, which is nice and large. We can movemonies around. I will tell you; each one of these investments look a little b it different. If you look at a deepwaterdevelopment, we end up with large wells on a production sense, high production rates, and because of that, hugeupfront cash flows. These projects come in, they have relatively high DD&A rates. But you look at their operatingexpense, they are extremely low and they have very strong margins. And it's back to economics.Now I will tell you that the cost structure in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico post -Macondo is higher. We have seen a20% to 25% rise in the cost of wells. I will tell you, we're trying to offset that in many other ways. Technology isone way. If you'll remember at our presentation in March this year and our recent press release, just around Ithink also in the March period where we talked about the perfo rmance of our multizone – the single – our multifracSingle-Trip FracPac. We had great success with that. It saved us anywhere from 20 to 50 days in thecompletion operations of our deepwater lower tertiary wells. This Multizone FracPac is a huge benefit for us in thecost side. In our original – in our initial test of the well after that, we had very high rates.So I'm going to take you back. It's back to what do we think we can get on value proposition? We've got the peopleto do the work in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and we've got the work capability also onshore. And we will makechoices on that, but it comes heavily back to the technical quality of the asset itself.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Edward G. WestlakeAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QSo some people have deferred projects, but at the moment the rig rates in subsea are not expensive enough giventechnology for you to do the same. Is that what I'm hearing?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. A
Our view of Jack/St. Malo today on an economic basis is stronger than when we went to FID. Our project view isimproved. As we learn more and more particularly about the lower tertiary and our ability to change the recoveryrates in the lower tertiary, we see this as a better and better opportunity. Remember when – the Jack/St. Malo, wetalked only of about a 500 million barrel type recovery for those two fields, and that was an 8% to 10% recoveryrate. We're focusing on those technologies that can change that recovery rate and potentially raise it up to over20%. And when you have the infrastructure in place already, that additional production and additional recovery is,frankly, very economic.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Edward G. WestlakeAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QThank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. ABut each one of them is a decision into itself. We have to have confidence in how much we're going to produce.And we have to also have confidence, and when we reach FID, we do have confidence in how much we will spendto get that return.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Edward G. WestlakeAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QVery clear. Thanks, George.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AOkay, Ed. Thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AOur next caller?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead withyour question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch QThanks. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, George.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AGood morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch QA question for you, George. I want to ask you about portfolio capital intensity. And I guess what I'm really tryingto understand is when you set the original target for 2017 , the CapEx numbers have been creeping higher. Butthere's a lot of stuff coming into the portfolio, on the margin anyway, that wasn't in the original plan; for example,the Permian Basin. So I'm trying to understand. Are things slipping to the right, as you mentioned in yourprepared remarks? And is spending basically making up the difference? And maybe just in order of magnitude,you're spending about 20% more than I guess your largest peer on a per barrel basis. I'm just curious if you canjust give us some flavor as to whether or not you think that is a sustainable level of spend.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. ALet me go back and say there are things that we had talked about, and I gave the example of the future growth, theexpansion in Tengiz, as moving to the right. When it moved to the right, when it moved later, it did move capitalthat way also. We look at these portfolio additions on the strength of them, and we don't only think about ourinvestment ratios on a per barrel basis. We are influenced heavily by the cash flow that these barrels give us.That's back to – I don't believe we would be investing for this much growth if we did not have the strength ofportfolio to generate the cash. Our earnings per barrel and our cash flow per barrel that we are generating allowsus, on a cash flow basis, to actually be investing much lower than many of our competitors. So we are investing ona cash basis less than most. It's heavily influenced, of course, by the quality and the amount of cash that we'regenerating from these barrels.I do believe that you're going to see our capital investment rate flatten with time, and it's really a function of theLNG projects that we're in today. We've got Gorgon and Wheatstone, which are very large. They build hugeinfrastructure and capacity for the future. They have very flat, long lives. So we're building for them, with them. Ialways tell people remember, when Gorgon and Wheatstone together are on, that's over 400,000 barrels net perday for Chevron. Those are company -sized assets.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch QMaybe I can just, my follow-up with Pat is a related question. Pat, you obviously have a lot of capital on thebalance sheet that's not generating earnings right now. What are your expectations for that trend? Does theproportion of capital rise or fall over the next several years, non-producing capital I mean? And I'll leave it there,thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. ARight. I think, consistent with where George was going, you are absolutely right. We are sustaining a relativelyhigh proportion of pre-productive capital, we call it, at the present time. You would expect that rate to besustained high until you get projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone coming online. Both of those two projectscombined represent about $45 billion Chevron share of spending over this seven-year period of time, if you look atthe construction period for both projects, so that's obviously a significant component. And until you get thoseprojects online, we're going to have relatively high pre -productive capital. Once those projects become online,then of course we anticipate that that proportionality will decline.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AEd, I'd just like to make one additional addition to that. I take you back to the ROCE we have in our upstreamsegment. Yes, we do have large capital employed that is not yet returning revenues and earnings. But even withthat, you look at the return on the capital employed in total, we are leading in our segment. That tells you wherewe've invested in the performance of that portfolio is very strong. So back to our ability to invest, it's drivenheavily by the quality of the existing portfolio to generate cash flow where we can invest in these large growthprojects, which are going to give us 25% volume growth between now and 2017 .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch QThanks for your answers, folks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with your question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengSenior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc. QHey, guys. Good morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AGood morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AGood morning, Paul.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengSenior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc. QGeorge, maybe a little bit of this from a strategic standpoint. As we're looking at Kitimat, in order for it to becomea really great project, you probably look beyond just Train 1 or 2. I don't know whether that you really havesufficient gas resource up there yourself. So strategically then, how should we look on it? So you would justessentially say okay, I have gas resource for the first two trains and I get it going. And then subsequently, I wouldjust be the owner of the train and not necessarily need to be the owner of the natural gas and just process otherpeople's gas, or that you actually think it's important for you guys to be fully integrated?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AThe second point first, I think it is very important to be fully integrated and to have the resource. Our view is beingtempered at this point in time because we haven't been in the project as long as Apache has. But I take you back tothe view that Apache is on the press with and what they view Liard and Horn River. Their view of Liard alone isapproximately 50 Tcf of gas. So if you take 50 Tcf of gas and you take Horn River and Liard, you've got somethinggreater than that. That is much more gas than is needed for a two -train plant. A two-train plant is more likely tobe in the 15 T of gas required.Bottom line, we are not short of gas at all in the Kitimat development. Our issue is to get the foundation customersand the foundation project in place, and then find a way to – the next step is to look at the expansions. I don'twant to spend a lot of time on the expansions yet until we really get past having the first two trains, once again,sold from a market point of view and then get them post FID.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengSenior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc. QRight. But I guess my question is that in the event if that those huge numbers that are talked about by Apache donot materialize and end up to be smaller, do you still want – we need to have an integrated model, including theownership in the resource?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AYes, I think we need that to have surety of the supply to feed the plant. So we're quite confident at this point forthe first two trains. We've done enough work that our confidence is high that there is a large volume of gas there.We have lots of appraisal work that will be done in Liard to confirm those volumes as we go forward. But I will tellyou, all my engagement with our partner, our partner is quite confident in the quality of this resource.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengSenior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc. QThe second one, George, can you give us some rough idea that based on your drilling results, how's the liquid rate,whether you have now frac oil, condensate, or NGL? What kind of split are we talking about in the Permian Basinthat you are drilling right now as well as in Utica?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AI can give you a lot more on what we're seeing in the Permian Basin. We're focu sing on the portion of the basinthat we see greater than 50% liquids. When I say 50% liquids, I'm looking at really the oil and condensate side.LNG is – pardon me, LPG is not what I'm speaking of. So really it's over 50% OEG in liquid, the oil andcondensate side. That's why we like it so much. That really carries a lot of value.In the Utica, I'm not really prepared to give you those numbers. I will just simply take you back to what I said inmy prepared comments for today that we are pleased with what we see. We've had about 30 days of productiontest, production run actually on the first two wells. It's a little early to speak on that. And we should be prepared alittle bit later in the third quarter to give a little bit more information on the Utica. But like I say, it's just a little bitearly. I would also tell you probably at the same time we would be prepared to speak a little bit more about theDuvernay in Canada because it is, once again, also a liquid play. And we've just closed on this addition al 67 ,000acres up in the Duvernay.I would tell you also, maybe as a general comment, what we've tried to do everywhere is to have a big anchorposition, like in the Permian Basin, and then build additional acreage around it before we disclose all our re sults.So it only makes sense for us not to get our disclosures out in front of where we're trying to move from acommercial point of view. We feel very good about where we are in the Permian Basin. And my expectation is if wehave another opportunities like Cimarex, we will make those happen too. But we like very much to get a niceposition, build that position, and it's particularly nice to build that position after you truly understand thesubsurface. You understand how the rocks are, and really how much of the volume is going to be oil or gas.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengSenior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc. QThe Permian, is that primarily frac oil, or is it primarily condensate for you?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AThe Permian is primarily oil.Paul Y. ChengSenior Vice President, Barclays Capital, Inc. QFrac oil for you, thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AThank you, Paul.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. ASo light oil.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jason D. GammelAnalyst, Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd. QThank you. I just wanted to follow up on LNG marketing, which has been raised by a few others. When you thinkabout putting Kitimat into the marketplace, how do you contrast that with the potential for brownfield expansionsat your Australian projects? And how do you prioritize getting one into the market versus the other? And then justrelated to that, what's your sense of urgency in getting volumes into the market right now given that there areprojects moving forward pretty quickly in both East A frica and on the U.S. Gulf Coast?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AA lot of questions there, Jason. I'll try to hit those. I'll start off with contrasting maybe our Gorgon Train 4 versuswhat we have at Kitimat. First difference is scale, and to the buyer we have a bigger offering of volume. We have 11million tons with two trains, and we are doing the joint marketing, so we have 11 million tons there on offer thatwill be available. And once again, we want to have 60% to 7 0%, and we would be willing very much to move up tothe 80% at the time of startup.In the case of Gorgon Train 4, it's a 5.2 million ton per annum additional train. The difference there is also the gascoming out of Gorgon is marketed by each of the partners. We will be marketing about 47% of the gas, andExxonMobil and Shell each have about 25%. So it's a much smaller volume to move for us. The plus for Gorgon isyou are brownfield, so you've got an advantage on the plant side. Depending upon where we're going in Asia, thereis no difference in transportation, in distance, in cost from going to Kitimat or coming from Australia. It actually,depending on where you're going, if it's in North Asia, there may be a slight advantage for Kit imat, so it could be apositive for us there. But volumemetrically it's positive.We do think from development cost that the development cost at Kitimat on the upstream may end up being lessthan in the case of Gorgon. Gorgon has the benefit of the brownfield on the plant side. We have, we think, morecontrol on the Kitimat project because of the partnership. We have 50% there and I think a very aligned partner.And we are jointly selling the gas, as I mentioned. In the case of Gorgon Train 4, three compan ies are selling thegas, so there is a different alignment there. We're happy to see both of them move. They are a little bit of a horserace between them at this point in our own shop.
East Africa I didn't mention, and I think people here are reminding me. I actually see East Africa behind both ofthese projects. I don't believe East Africa, from my perspective yet, has an operator that's in place or a unit thathas been created to move that project forward. So I think we do have a timing advantage on bo th of those projectsto first gas. Gorgon, we know we've got all the gas. Kitimat, we're confident we've got all the gas for two trains. So Ithink we have a little bit of an advantage there. And we do know our fiscal regime and regulatory regime in boththe locations in which we operate very clearly.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AOkay. Thank you, Jason.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Your next...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AI think we have time for a couple more questions.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Okay. Our next question is all set from Iain Reid with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Iain S. ReidAnalyst, Jefferies International Ltd. QYes, hi there. Pat, could I ask you a question actually about the share buyback? You said earlier you're moving intomore of a net debt position going forward. You're obviously spending both on CapEx and dividends significantlymore than you're generating in cash flow at the moment , and the buyback is accelerating that process into netdebt. At what point do you think the buyback has done its job in terms of that process? Have you got a target levelof gearing which you're aiming for? And when can we think about you perhaps scaling this back over the nextseveral quarters? Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AIt's a good question. I think I've explained before how we look at share buybacks, and it really is – we try to take amedium-term point of view. We take a look at what's happening to commodity prices. We look at what ouropportunity for reinvestment in the business is. We look at, obviously, a growing dividend profile that we want tomake sure comes right off the top. We want to maintain flexibility in our financial structure. And after we've donethat equation, if there are funds left over, that's when we fall into the share repurchase category. We do want totake – we have tried to take a more medium-term point of view here and not be in and out of the market justdepending upon instantaneous circumstances in a given quarter.We do not have a targeted leverage ratio for the corporation. We look at the – we look at the leverage ratio reallyas being an outcome of these other decisions that we have made. And we have tremendous additional leveragecapacity, as you well know. If we're sitting here today with a 12% debt ratio, we have a long way to go before beingover-levered becomes one of our problems. So I think you can consider when you look out and forecast your owncommodity prices and take a look at the development stream that we've got available to us and you look at ourpast practice on dividend streams, you can put together a cash flow model. We have a long way to go be fore netdebt becomes a challenge for us.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Iain S. ReidAnalyst, Jefferies International Ltd. QOkay, thanks for that. And could I just ask one very quick question for George? On Brazil, George, you talkedabout Frade coming gradually back onstream. But in that kind of growth profile you're showing for the second halfof the year, is Papa Terra in there? And also I wonder if you could also comment on Chevron's view of the pre -saltround coming up in Brazil?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AOkay. Frade, as you said, is part of that addition in the second half. We had no production in Frade in the firstquarter. Second quarter, it averaged about 5,000 barrels a day. Our share the month of June, we were c loser to10,000 barrels a day our share. So there is some expectation there that we will grow in the second half or we willhave more volume in the second half on Frade. Not too far off from our original plan, the field is performing, atthis point, pretty well. So that's a plus.On the case of Papa Terra, Papa Terra may come on production this year, but it's not going to be a significantmover on production. Petrobras is still talking about bringing it on this year, but it's late in the year. So we do notbelieve that it will be a significant mover on our production for the year.With regards to the deepwater round, as on all our exploration opportunities, we review the opportunity set, andwe never disclose up front what we think of it. We always talk about what we did afterward and give more color atthat point in time.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Iain S. ReidAnalyst, Jefferies International Ltd. QOkay, George. Thanks very much................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. AThank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AOkay, thank you. I think we've got one more – time for one more question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Okay. Our final question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Faisel H. KhanAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker) QThanks. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Just on the key exploration wells and acreage additions, it seems like youguys definitely added a good amount of acreage during the year and a few bolt-on acquisitions. Can you just giveus an idea of what the – how much of that is your capital budget has that made up, and what's your appetite goingforward? And then I just have one follow-up on the downstream side.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................George Lawrence KirklandVice Chairman, Executive VP-Upstream & Gas, Chevron Corp. ARight offhand, I'd have to do a little bit of work because I think about 25% or 30% of our monies are outside of ourfocus areas on the drilling side, so it's in that range. We like to keep – in the past we've tried to push usually asmuch as 80%. So we're more in the 7 0% this year in our focus areas. And that's – once again, I haven't looked atthe numbers exactly where we are for the year, but the plan was we were going to be a little bit lighter in our focusareas this year.Our appetite is driven by a couple of things. It's of course the amount of money we have to spend and also thescale and the quality of the opportunity. It starts very much with the quality of the rock. If the rock do esn't work,we don't view the risk and the scale of the opportunity to be attractive. We don't go there. So it's not about acreage,it's about quality. Preferentially, if possible, we like to be in a low-cost option situation; i.e., we like to get a nicepiece of acreage with a seismic obligation and minimal or low numbers of wells to drill. And that's particularly thecase in these test areas, these areas outside of our focus areas. We don't want to get saddled with a really largeprogram and then drill a high-risk well and find out it's not very attractive. So we tend to try to do that everywherearound the world, and a lot of these opportunities that we've moved into recently are very much structured thatway; not a large amount of costs on upfront entry, and they have seismic obligations and small drilling obligationsto answer really the geological question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Faisel H. KhanAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker) QOkay, got it. And just on the downstream earnings results, first, focused on the U.S. downstream results, if Iextract out the chemicals earnings, which I guess we can get that through Phillips 66, it seems like U.S.downstream earnings are basically breakeven, even first quarter and second quarter. And given the refiningposition and marketing position you guys have, I would have thought that there would be a lot more profitabilityout of these assets. So can you give us an idea of how these assets are going to deliver that level of profitability? Iknow you've talked about Richmond being down, and I know some of the environmental expenses associated withthat. But can you talk about how this – taking out chemicals, how does U.S. downstream perform in the way itprobably should?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AAll right. First of all, I think the key item is one that you already mentioned for our performance in the first half,and it does have to do with unit downtime. If I look at the first six months of this year and look at what ourutilization rates were for our – this will be worldwide, but it's obviously heavily influenced by the assets that wehave in the U.S. If I look at our operated utilization rates for the first half, it's running a good 10 points or so belowwhat you would have seen on average for the 2011 or 2012 time period, and that is a big penalty to absorb from anearnings standpoint. As we go forward and we look at the second half of the year, I did mention that Richmond isup and fully operational. But as we look at the second half of the year, the vast majority of our downtime is alreadyin the rearview window at this point. So I think going forward if we can run reliably, then you'll have a muchbetter outcome.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Faisel H. KhanAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker) QOkay, great. Thanks for your time. I appreciate it.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.Okay
, I think that concludes the call for the day, and I appreciate everybody's interest and listening in today, and Iparticularly appreciate the questions that came in from the analysts. Sean, I'll turn it back over to you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's second quarter 2013 earnings conferencecall. You may now disconnect.
