General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron

Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Roderick Green,
General Manager of Investor Relations. And on the call with me today is Pierre Breber, CFO. We will refer to
slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2.
Now, I'll turn it over to Pierre.

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Roderick. This quarter, we had our best financial performance of the last year, as the global economy
recovers. Reported earnings were $1.4 billion, and adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion, or $0.90 per share.
Included in the quarter were pension settlement costs and legal reserves totaling $351 million. Pension settlement
and curtailment costs will be a special item going forward. For comparability purposes, 2020 adjusted earnings
were recast to exclude these costs. Also found in the appendix to this presentation is a reconciliation of nonGAAP measures. CapEx was down over 40% from a year ago and we ended the quarter with a net debt ratio of
22.5%.
For the first time since the pandemic, cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, exceeded our cash
CapEx and dividend spending. Cash balances ended the quarter slightly higher due to timing considerations. We
expect cash balances to come back down later in the year.
Free cash flow, excluding working capital, was $3.4 billion, up significantly from last year and higher than the
2019 quarterly average. With oil prices back up to around 2019 levels and downstream earnings still recovering,
higher free cash flow this quarter is driven by the change in cash CapEx, less than half of the 2019 quarterly
average.
Maintaining and growing our dividend remains our top financial priority. Earlier this week, Chevron's board of
directors approved a $0.05 per share dividend increase, about 4%, that positions Chevron to extend our streak to
34 consecutive years of higher annual dividend per share payouts. Since 2005, Chevron's dividend per share has
grown over 7% per year, beating the S&P 500 and more than four times our peer average.

When our first three financial priorities have been met, we also have a track record of repurchasing shares 13 out
of the past 17 years. As we look forward, we expect to begin the repurchase of shares when we're confident that
we can sustain a buyback program for multiple years through the oil price cycle. When making this decision, we'll
consider the likelihood of future sustained excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet.
Adjusted first quarter earnings decreased about $700 million versus the same quarter last year. Upstream
earnings increased on higher prices and downstream earnings declined on a swing in timing effects and lower
margins and volumes resulting from the pandemic. Both segments had negative impacts from Winter Storm Uri.
Other was down primarily due to employee benefit costs.
Compared with last quarter, adjusted upstream earnings were up more than $1.4 billion due to higher prices.
Downstream earnings increased primarily due to margins and timing effects, including the absence of last
quarter's year-end inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million. Other was down in part due to
employee benefit costs.
Upstream production was down 3.5% from a year ago. The increase in production due to the Noble acquisition
was more than offset by a number of factors, including declines, asset sales, Winter Storm Uri, and OPEC+
curtailments.
Winter Storm Uri impacted both our upstream and downstream businesses with earnings impact of about $300
million after tax in the quarter. All upstream production has been restored, and major downstream and chemical
units have restarted.
We also achieved first gas flow from the successful execution of the Alen Gas Monetization Project in Equatorial
Guinea. This project allows gas from the Alen field to be processed through existing onshore facilities.
Finally, the company announced an agreement to acquire all of the publicly held common units in NBLX. This
stock transaction is expected to close in mid-May.
We continued to take action to advance a lower carbon future. Last week, we announced an MOU with Toyota to
work together to develop commercially viable, large-scale businesses in hydrogen. Also, we've continued to invest
in emerging low-carbon technologies, including announcing five venture investments this year in geothermal
power, offshore wind and green ammonia.
In addition, we're in the early stages of developing a bioenergy project with carbon capture and sequestration in
Mendota, California. This plant is expected to convert agricultural waste biomass, such as almond trees, into a
gas to generate electricity and sequester emissions of 300,000 tons of CO2 annually.
Looking ahead, in the second quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by 90,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia at Gorgon Train 3, where the planned turnaround and
repairs of propane vessels are underway.
The impact from OPEC curtailments is estimated to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in
Kazakhstan. In Kazakhstan, the FGP project recently placed the final module on its foundation. Remobilization of
the construction workforce achieved about 95% of the end of first quarter objective. Further workforce additions
are expected this quarter.

In summary, it was a good quarter with our strongest financial performance in a year, continued progress towards
advancing a lower carbon future and a dividend increase while maintaining an industry-leading balance sheet.
During last month's Investor Day, we shared our goal of higher returns, lower carbon. This quarter was another
step in that direction. As we look forward to the next few quarters and the world gets better control of this virus,
I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver stronger financial performance and help advance a lower carbon future.
With that, I'll turn it over to Roderick.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions.

A

Hi, Jeanine.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeanine Wai
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Hi. Good morning. Our first question, Pierre, maybe just a housekeeping item on the numbers, can you provide a
little more color on the moving pieces for cash flow this quarter? It came in a little below Street expectations. And I
guess if we're doing it right, we apply your cash flow sensitivity per dollar change in Brent, and we're still coming
up with a higher cash flow number than reported despite Winter Storm Uri. So, we're just wondering if we're
missing any other one-offs other than the pension settlements since I know there was a lot going on this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, thanks. Our dividend break-even the past couple of quarters with weak downstream margins has been
around $50. It was a little higher this quarter. There was nothing operational except Winter Storm Uri. It's really
primarily due to some non-operational items like accruals for legal reserves and taxes. Those are non-cash in the
quarter, but when we look at cash flow, excluding working capital, of course, we're taking out that working capital
effect, so those kinds of accruals, which are charges result in a lower cash flow ex working capital.

I'll point out, though, that our free cash flow in the first quarter of 2021 was higher than free cash flow in 2019,
even though 2019 had much stronger downstream margins and similar oil prices, and that's primarily because of
the cash CapEx.
So, I think you're doing the calculation right. The tricky thing about these cash flow break-evens is you don't hold
everything else constant, all the other margins and indicators and then some of these timing effects on accruals.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeanine Wai
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Okay. Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then maybe my second question on the buyback and free cash
flow. So, on our projections, we see pretty strong near-term free cash flow, and the trajectory, it really
meaningfully steps up in 2024, 2025 with Tengiz and some of your long-cycle GOM projects starting up in the
Permian. So, I think to us, this suggests that for the buyback, it makes a lot of sense to [ph] leg into a (00:10:43)
program kind of similar to what you did in 2018 and 2019 versus a consistent amount per year, which I think was
the last commentary before the pandemic, which I know changed a ton of things. So, can you provide any
thoughts on how you envision the buyback getting reinstated?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

We have a track record of buying back shares pretty consistently. 13 of last 17 years, over $50 billion of buybacks
since that time at an average price in the mid-80s, less than $1 higher than the ratable price if we've been in for
every single day during that whole time period.
As I said on the prepared remarks, when we start a program, if and when we start a program, we'll want to sustain
it for multiple years because we want to get it through the commodity price cycle. Shareholders feel differently
about buybacks. There's a concern that we only buy back when our share price is high. That's a perception.
That's not the reality because I just shared with you the actual numbers, but that's a perception that we have to
deal with. So, at the common ground we find is when we start a program, have confidence that we can sustain it
for multiple years, and we're going to look to those two factors: the likelihood of future excess cash generation
and the strength of the balance sheet to weather a down cycle in oil prices that we know is going to happen.
So, we're not yet on a sustained global economic recovery. We feel very good about where we are here in the
United States and several other countries, but there are a number of countries where we're still working to get
control of the virus, and so we think it's appropriate. We increased the dividend, which is consistent with our
financial priorities. We don't need – we're not going to increase the capital this year, and we have tight guidance
out five years. We have the balance sheet in a very good place. So, yes, in the short-term, any excess cash is
going to go to the balance sheet, but over time, excess cash will be returned to shareholders in the form of higher
dividends like you saw us announce a couple days ago and in the form of a buyback over time.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate

Q

Analyst, Bank of America Merill Lynch

Well, thanks. Good morning, Pierre. Good morning, Roderick, and congratulations on your first earnings call.
I wonder, Pierre, if I could just hit what might be the 800-pound gorilla in the room, which is the acquisition of
Noble. The production seems to have kind of disappeared in the mix and it's raising some questions, at least from
people we speak to, about whether Chevron is under-investing to sustain that long-term production capacity.
What would your response be to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

We're not under-investing. We showed during our Investor Day that we're very capital efficient, and at our $14
billion to $16 billion, we in fact are going to grow production around 3%. We're not – that's not an ambition of us to
have production growth, it's an outcome of what's a very capital efficient program.
Jeanine mentioned we're investing to increase production at Tengiz. We don't have that production now and that's
$2.5 billion in the budget at Tengiz. So, we have our eye on long-term value through this whole crisis.
If you really step back to when this started about a year ago, we did hit short-term capital pretty hard. We kept our
eye on long-term value. We didn't see the virtue in investing capital to add short-term production in a world that
was going to be oversupplied for some time period, and arguably still is with OPEC+ barrels constrained. And
again, we're not back to a full sustained economic recovery, but we preserve the options on long-term value.
I'm very cognizant that we have a dividend obligation. We're one of the few companies that didn't cut the dividend.
We're the only company that's increased the dividend, and really, a dividend increase that averages 6% per year
during a very difficult time. And we showed during our Investor Day that we have the capability to grow free cash
flow 10% per year over five years and that's coming from Tengiz, which we'll see in a couple of years and growth
in the Permian when the world needs the barrel.
So, we're not going to chase short-term production. We don't see value in that. Our production guidance for this
year is unchanged. It's 0% to 3%. You saw our reserve replacement numbers. The Noble acquisition undoubtedly
has helped.
Remember, we showed and Mike showed at the last quarter call that we've invested actually the same amount
that we expected post-COVID as pre-COVID. Pre-COVID, we would have set $20 billion a year for last year and
this year, about $40 billion. Organically, we're only going to do about $13 billion or $14 billion each year, that
when you add in the $12 billion or $13 billion from Noble, or is exactly where we were pre-COVID. So, we are not
under-investing. We have to sustain and grow the enterprise, but we're doing it in a very capital-efficient way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merill Lynch

Q

I appreciate the full answer, Pierre. And my follow-up is actually related to CapEx. So, I guess a quick one, but
you are obviously running well below your run rate for the year. Is that just a timing issue? How would you expect
cadence to look over the balance of the year? And I'll leave it there, but thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, thanks, Doug. It is really timing. I mean, first quarter is normally a little light. Winter Storm Uri, obviously,
you're not drilling wells when you're shutting in production and dealing with the challenges of that extraordinary
winter event. And then there is just timing of some major capital projects that are more back-end loaded.
So, no change to our guidance of a $14 billion organic program. You saw a small inorganic acquisition in the first
quarter numbers, so that can be different going forward, but from an organic perspective, we're going to stick with
the budget. We're running a little low as you say. We think we'll end up pretty close to the budget by year end.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Hey, Pierre. My first question here is actually a bit of a follow-up on the cash flow in the quarter. There was a
$500 million headwind from affiliate cash flows in the quarter in the cash flow statement. And in the last quarter
call, you had given a guidance for the full year of a $0 to $500 million headwind. There was not an update given in
the slides this time, so I was wondering if it was just front-end loaded or if there's any change to that. And I
recognize the affiliates also can tie into the Tengiz co-lend, so has that guidance changed either? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, thanks, Phil. We didn't change our guidance because it's just early. I think you're right. I think you're
inferring that the guidance particularly for Tengiz will get better. We gave a co-lending guidance of $1 billion to $2
billion. Right now, we'd be at the low-end of the range, in fact, we could be at zero depending on if prices stay
where they are right now.
So, you should expect us to update that guidance at midyear when we see a little more time with commodity
prices. But clearly at Tengiz, when we have prices over $60, that reduces the need for co-lending and might not
require any. And again, you could see a dividend out of Tengiz. That's a decision for the TCO shareholders to
make, but we have not had a dividend now for I think two or three years, and so that would also be positive.
In terms of affiliates, I mean that cash flow line, again, is the difference between earnings from affiliates and the
dividends. The dividends were about flat between fourth quarter and this quarter, so that's not a variance on the
cash flow. But you're right that there's some timing in that. Some of the Winter Storm Uri effects kind of factor into
CP Chem. Again, we'll update that guidance when we get to midyear.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Okay. And then the second question is on Tengiz. You're obviously continuing to ramp the head count. I think at
this point, most investors are assuming some kind of delay in the start-up timing as well as impacts to costs from
that potential delay. Kind of hard to overcome maybe a timing delay, but is it possible that you can still, in your
mind, be able to do this within budget, even with the timing delays? I recognize you haven't given an official
update here, but I just want to get your latest thinking. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, thanks. Let me just take us back or start with the Investor Day. We were at 22,000. We remobilized to
25,000 just short of our 26,000 first quarter objective, and you saw where we plan to go in the second quarter. I
mean I cited also a big milestone was getting the last of 86 modules on to the foundation, so we're still making
very good progress. We are managing through a pandemic. We have all the safeguards in place. They're working.
We have a very low rate of positive cases right now.
We've also started a vaccination program at Tengiz. It includes both the project and the producing operations
staff, so it's not just for the project, also for the base operations. We've been allocated about 10,000 doses and
administered already 7,000. Future vaccinations, though, will depend on more allocations from the Republic of
Kazakhstan. This is not a company program. We're doing it with the government and are allocated by the
government in Kazakhstan.
So, to answer your question, and at this time, there's more pressure on schedule than costs. We have a backlog
of work because of the demobilization last year and having to isolate work teams at times when we do have a
positive case. It's possible but hard to fully make up the schedule. And we also have incurred higher costs as a
result of COVID, but we've had some cost efficiencies and some foreign exchange benefits that may be able to
offset the higher costs.
So, as we've said in the past, we need to demonstrate that we can remobilize, fully remobilize, stay at full
numbers, meet productivity targets, and achieve our milestones, while managing through a pandemic. And the
spring and summer work campaigns are very important to give us the data that will help us get a reliable update
on costs and schedule.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.

Q

Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Devin J. McDermott
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

My first one is a follow-up on some of the production questions from earlier, and it relates more specifically to the
Permian, and I think one of the things that stood out in your recent Investor Day was the fact that even at a much
lower capital spending level, you were still able to achieve a similar level of growth in the Permian over the next
two years deferred slightly versus pre-COVID plans, but still attractive growth there.
As you think about the resumption of activity to facilitate that growth here over the next few years, can you talk a
little bit about the cadence and timing or from a market standpoint what signals in terms of oil prices or otherwise
that you need to see to begin increasing activity there to resume that planned production ramp?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, we've been focused on three metrics, three conditions. So again, oil prices are going to move up and down.
We're focused on the fundamentals. We've been looking to three indicators.
The first is the global economy on a sustained path to recovery. Not quite there yet, clearly optimistic here in the
United States with high vaccination rates and the stimulus package, a few other countries, but again, a number of
countries don't have control over the virus. So, we need to get on a sustained path of economic recovery.
The second is we need to see OPEC+ barrels get back into the market. We're starting to see that. We need to
have clarity on what actions we're going to take, but there's still a lot of production that is being curtailed.
And then the third, and I think the third condition has been largely met is inventory back to near-normal, and so
the inventory surplus for the most part has been worked off. So, I'd say one of the three conditions.
Now, that's for us to increase CapEx, not this year, our budget is fixed this year at $14 billion, but within the $14
billion to $16 billion five-year guidance that we talked about. So, we're still talking about a modest increase.
In terms of the Permian, everything is going very well there. The first quarter production was clearly impacted by
Winter Storm Uri. That's about 60,000 barrels of oil-equivalent a day for the quarter. But if you take that out,
production, I think, looks good.
Our declines, we shared last – second quarter, Jay shared that. Production could decline 6% to 7% if we stayed
at low activity levels. It's probably a little bit better than that, it might be closer to 5%, but undoubtedly, we're at the
low investment levels that we're doing right now, we'll see some declines. That is okay. That is the correct
response to an oversupplied market, in particular, again, when we're keeping our eye on long-term value.
So, what you could see later this year is we could bring – right now, operated we have five rigs, two completion
crews, our net non-op is a similar rig count. Certainly, we could bring back a completion crew later this year and
that would help us reduce some of our drilled and uncompleted wells. But in terms of getting on the trajectory that
we showed at our Investor Day, there's still time.
I mean, that outlook kind of factored in that we would still be in this kind of not-full recovery at this point in time.
And then it ramps up over next year and the year after that. So, can we do it faster? We absolutely can. Can we
hold it where we're at here longer if necessary? We can. It's very flexible. It's the appropriate response.
But the long-term value, and the point, I think, of your question is there, right? The million barrels a day that we
showed in 2025, but more importantly, highly-accretive to returns, strong free cash flow, right? Free cash flow
positive last year, growing free cash flow, so it's a fantastic position we have. We're advantaged because of the
royalty. We intend to invest in there, but we're going to do it at the right time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Devin J. McDermott
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And as we think about decarbonization, energy transition and returns, I think
you've got a very thoughtful approach on that and focusing on returns, enhancing investments, decarbonizing
your existing portfolio, integrating renewables and the portfolio has been one of the pillars there.
You've had some progress here over the past few months in both venture activities you highlighted in the slide,
the hydrogen MOU, and my question is, you've seen some of your peers in the industry form new business
ventures focused specifically on commercializing technology and scaling up new business opportunities to
hopefully become growth engines over time, returns-enhancing growth engines.
Can you talk a little bit more about Chevron's strategy for transitioning some of the investments and opportunities
you may be able to capture so far into new growth ventures over time, including in a monetization strategy or
scaling strategy for some of the venture investments that you've talked about here in your prepared remarks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, look, you summarized our strategy pretty well. I'll hit it really quickly. The first is to make the oil and gas that
we produce as low carbon as we can. We put out 2028 targets that have a 35% reduction. We think we're top
quartile. We'll stay top quartile, and we showed a slide that said we'd go beyond that and get the carbon intensity
down into the mid-teens in terms of kilograms per barrels of oil equivalent. So, that's the first. That's really done in
the segments. That's really where the work gets done.
The second is to increase renewable energy alongside our conventional products, so renewable natural gas sold
along with conventional natural gas, renewable diesel sold alongside our conventional diesel. You've seen – we're
going to co-process at our LA refinery later this year, biofeed along with conventional feed, and make renewable
products, have renewable diesel, biodiesel at more than half of our service stations in the United States. So, good
progress there.

And then the third is to grow low-carbon businesses, and that's exactly – that's hydrogen carbon capture. The
venture investments are important, and they are really making sure we're staying connected to all of the latest
technology, but we intend to do exactly what you say is grow these businesses.
So, let me talk about Project Mendota in California. It's in partnership with Schlumberger and Microsoft. It's going
to capture the emissions from agricultural waste, so they burn almond trees after a certain number of productive
seasons. Normally, those emissions just go to the atmosphere. This project will capture those emissions, convert
it into a synthetic gas that can then generate power and use that power to compress the CO2 and inject it in the
ground and then sell excess power into the grid. And that's a project that's in now front-end engineering and
design.
We're looking at another carbon capture pilot with Svante in Bakersfield. So, the venture investments is an
enabler to growing hydrogen carbon capture business. That's exactly what we intend to do over time. These are
nascent businesses. It'll require lots of partnerships, but we're going to be a player in it.

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. So, the first one is just on Gorgon. Pierre, can you just talk
about the state of play there? It sounds like Train 3 is going down, and in the back half, you're going to be running
closer to nameplate capacity. But could you just talk about maintenance there and where we stand with the
project?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Neil, it's pretty straightforward. We're doing the scheduled Train 3 turnaround separately, or it just – it turns
out it's at the same time we're able to do the repairs we expect that to be completed by the end of this quarter.
And then you're right, we'd be operating all three trains in the second half of the year.
There was a short – there was a time period in the first quarter where we saw all three trains operating between
the Train 1 turnaround and the start of the Train 3 work. So, we know what those units can do, and we're excited
to get back to it here in the third quarter.
Wheatstone will have a planned turnaround late third quarter early fourth quarter, but again, we expect Gorgon to
be running full during the second half of this year.

And Pierre, you guys have been really good at M&A, being opportunistic, willing to step away when the bid went
away from you, and taking in assets like Noble towards the bottom of the cycle. It's a core competency for
Chevron. As you look at the landscape, how do you think about M&A and whether there are opportunities out
there, and how are you evaluating them?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Neil, yeah, we're really happy with the Noble acquisition. Again, if we step back and think of July, it was still an
uncertain time, and announcing – being the first to announce a major transaction closing at 1st in October, having
now two quarters where we've been integrated, seeing everything we said the free cash flow accretion, the
returns accretion, earnings accretion, the synergies doubled from $300 million to $600 million, achieved 80% of
them, we'll get the rest before the year end. Good – very happy with the talent from the Noble employees that
have come across DJ Basin, Eastern Med, so again, what was a very good deal looks even better now.
Now, look, it's a challenge to obviously replicate that. We'll always be looking. We have a very high bar. Noble got
over the bar with the quality assets and the value that we saw. We don't need to do an acquisition. To Doug's
earlier question, we are sustaining and growing this enterprise. I'm very cognizant of that, and again, we need to
do that to sustain and grow the dividend.
At the same time, there's times inorganic can enhance the company, and so if we see something that will make
that Investor Day story we told even better, then we'll pursue it. I do think industry consolidation will continue.
Undoubtedly, valuations have moved from back where we were in July. It's a long game. We're very patient, and
again, we don't need to do a transaction.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Scotiabank

Q

Pierre, two question. First, among your peers that I think you have [indiscernible] (00:31:48) heavier concentration
in California. And with the governor's latest proposal, how that may impact your overall operation, or how you may
restructure it or if you do need to restructure it? So, I want to see that how you guys are thinking about the policy
outlook impacting on your business in California both in the downstream and upstream.

The second question that if we look at some of the smaller [indiscernible] (00:32:22) in the last – E&P, in the last
12 months, I think one of the movement is into the variable dividend, which is never a thing for the major oil
companies such as you guys. You guys always use the share buyback. So, just curious that internally that have
the board and management even consider the variable dividend versus buyback to see which is a better way to
return cash to the shareholder?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Sure, thanks, Paul. I'll answer your second question first. Of course, we pay close attention to what everybody
does. We have not been convinced that there's a better cash return story than what we do, which is a steadilygrowing dividend, again, with a 4% increase announced, 34th consecutive year of growing dividends, 7%
compounded rate for the last 15 years, and a ratable buyback program, 13 out of 17 years, very close to the
actual ratable price during that whole time.
So, we talk to our shareholders all the time. I think our shareholders support our framework, but of course, we'll
keep an open mind but we don't see the value in it.
Look, I think those approaches are gaining favor in part because dividends have been cut by other companies
and other actions that have not been as consistent as predictable and as reliable as what we've done over that
track record of 34 years on the dividend and 17 years on the buyback.
If you go to California policy, there is – I'm not sure exactly which one you're referring to. There's an internal
combustion, I don't know if it's a ban or a rule-making proposal to reduce that by I think 2035. There's also a – the
governor requested the rule makers to look at rules on hydraulic fracturing. What I can say is that certainly on
hydraulic fracturing, it's been done safely in California under comprehensive regulations for a long time. It's been
done safely elsewhere in the United States, and safely all around the world. And I think when policies restrict
supply, it just moves energy production to jurisdictions that likely have less regulation, and it also moves the jobs
and the government revenues and increases the trade deficit. And I'll say the jobs in oil and gas are good paying
jobs that you can raise a family on.
So, in terms of our operations, if some sort of hydraulic fracturing ban was implemented through the rulemaking
process, it would not be material to Chevron's upstream operations in California. It impacts future drilling at a field
that represents less than 10% of our production. Of course, we'll work with Governor Newsom, though, to make
those rules as – advance the environmental objectives while continuing to support the jobs and the economic
benefits of our industry.
In terms of any kind of internal combustion engine ban, what I'd say is we support the Paris Agreement, we
support a price on carbon. Light passenger vehicles represent less than 10% of global greenhouse gas
emissions, so let's make sure we also focused on the other 90%. But if we want to look at to EVs and
transportation, put a price on carbon, and let the technologies compete in the marketplace.
Thanks, Paul. We'll go to the next question.

Q

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Good morning. Well, Ryan's loss, my gain. A couple of things I'd like to follow up on more look-back and lookforward. Gorgon in the first quarter, we had some fairly significant gas prices, you're typically more contracted
than spot market. I was just wondering how that performed at a time where you were probably weren't able to
participate much in the spot market. I was just curious how you covered the contracted side and how you think
about that a little bit going forward.
And then the other question I had hasn't gotten much play recently, but is part of the curtailments within OPEC+.
How the neutral zone restart is going, what the impacts are there for you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Sure. So, on Australia, we've said that with one train down at Gorgon, which has been largely the case since
midyear last year, if you think of our Australia system as having five trains and so four out of five trains have been
operating, that lines up pretty close with our contract. So, it's not an exact match because some of the
Wheatstone contracts and Gorgon contracts are a little bit different, but fundamentally, we're balanced. So, yeah,
the real opportunity cost from the Gorgon downtime was not participating in the spot market, so we didn't get the
benefit of relatively balanced. There were some trading puts and takes I would say in the LNG spot market, but
nothing worth pointing out.
In terms of PZ, that ramp-up continues very well. It's at 60,000 barrels a day our share, pre the shut-in it was
about 80,000, so we expect to get there here during the course of the year. And then of course any OPEC+
curtailments, at this point in time, it's not being curtailed but that's really subject to the local governments.

Q

Hey, guys. I just quickly wanted to focus on two questions on the California project. The first one is because you
are sequestering and storing in California, does that mean that on top of IRS 45Q credits, you also get the LCFS
credits? Because if you're not storing in California as I understand, then LCFS is not available. And the quick
follow-up there is why almond tree? Is it only because the carbon intensity is minus 80, or is it also because it's
just you and one more guy chasing that feedstock so what we're seeing in the soybean oil market that doesn't
replicate? So, if you could tell us why almond tree as a feedstock?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, well, let me just step back for a moment. Just remember, we're just talking about transportation. That's the
fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions globally, right? The first is manufacturing; second, power
generation; third is agriculture and land use; and then fourth is transportation. So, agriculture and land use is an
important source of greenhouse gas emissions. You've seen our work in renewable natural gas, which again
captures the methane from dairy cows and so that's a worthwhile area for us to look into.
So, the agricultural waste is just that's what happens is it gets burned and those emissions go to the atmosphere.
And so, partnering with Schlumberger and Microsoft, that's a worthwhile project to capture an emission that
otherwise would be burnt – emitted to the atmosphere and converting it and sequestering essentially and
generating some excess power.
So, it's early days. You're right, it's all policy-enabled including federal policy and California state policy. We're
doing the front engineering, lot of work to do, but I think you're getting the right idea is that we're looking for
projects that are higher-return, lower-carbon. And so, this is a project that we can generate a return with the policy
support and reduces carbon. Thanks, Manav.

Ryan M. Todd
Analyst, Simmons Energy

Q

Sorry about that. My phone call dropped right as you asked me a question. Maybe if I could follow up on one of
the earlier questions in terms of the restarting of the buyback. I mean you walked through two of the things that
you needed to see, which was sustainable excess cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet. You
mentioned the near-term cash goes on to the balance sheet. Is that because it's just a place to hold the cash
while the sustainability gets to a level of confidence that you're okay with, or is that because you actually feel like
the balance sheet needs to be strengthened a little bit more before you restart the buyback?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

It's a bit of both. I mean, it's just how the math works, right? If you have excess cash and you don't change your
capital program, the dividend would just increase, so that's not going to change. So, just by definition, it goes to
the balance sheet.
And so – but it also – I think you can infer in my comments that, again, we're looking to future excess cash
generation and the strength of the balance sheet to weather the commodity price cycle. So, I'm not going to give
you a hard target. We're going to use judgment because there's judgment on future excess cash generation.
This is our first quarter actually with current excess cash generation. We expect the next couple of quarters to be
potentially even better because you've got oil prices above $60, refining and chemicals margins much stronger,
so it could be even better. At the same time, we don't have a sustained global economic recovery, so it's
reasonable for us to be cautious. We want to be confident that when we start the program, we're going to continue
it for multiple years and we can sustain it through an oil price cycle.
So, I know that folks want a formula or a trigger. I know some of our competitors have those numbers. We're
going to use judgment and we're going to consider what we see in front of us in terms of the likelihood of future
excess cash generation. We're going to want the balance sheet in a strong enough position that if oil prices cycle
down, we can continue the buyback program relying on the balance sheet.
Our balance sheet is very strong right now, but yes, in the short term, excess cash is going to go to the balance
sheet. That's kind of by definition, but it also serves the dual purpose of lowering our net debt ratio and putting us
in a better position for when we start, if and when we start a buyback program.

Q

Thanks. And then maybe on a separate topic, if we talk a little bit about refining, I know you don't comment on
news headlines. You were mentioned recently in a news article connecting to a potential refinery acquisition in the
US Northwest. You did acquire a refinery in recent years. Can you talk about how you think about your portfolio
exposure on the downstream side in general, appetite for increasing or reducing that exposure in any way, and
how your general view on the refining outlook over the medium term may play into how you look at managing your
portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, so again, I won't comment specifically on that report. The refinery in the Gulf Coast is very small acquisition
that we made. It was something that I had foreshadowed. I was leading the business at that point in time.
Because we'd only had one refinery in the Gulf Coast region, we were, I think the only company really, major
company with that setup, we did not – we were on the Eastern side of the Gulf Coast in Mississippi, and so our
retail in Texas was supplied by third-party barrels. So, we had talked about that. We didn't have to do that, but
when the opportunity came and that transaction is kind of working as we envisioned.

So, on the West Coast, we're in a much different place. We have a two-refinery system, we have a leading brand,
really strong infrastructure. We are growing a little bit in Mexico, some of our retail volumes there, so I'd just say
we're in a strong position on the West Coast. And in the Gulf Coast, we were also strong, but we felt we could
make us even better by getting something on the Eastern side and the Texas side, and we did that. So, I wouldn't
read too much into it. We did a small Australia retail fuels, which again was enabled our value chain out of Asia,
so there's been some very targeted modest acquisitions in the refining business and retail business. But for the
most part, you know that we have a focused geographic footprint, very competitive business.
As we look forward, look, it's going to get better. Winter Storm Uri, as difficult as that event was for everybody in
the region, one of the outcomes was it tightened inventories for fuels and especially for chemicals, so those
margins have recovered a little more quickly than they otherwise would have, and we think the next couple
quarters are going to be good and we're well-positioned in our downstream and chemicals business.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gabelman
Analyst, Cowen and Company

Q

Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I guess following up on the downstream since that's being discussed, can
you just comment on specifically your markets, your focus on California and kind of the Asia Pacific region? It
seems like vaccine deployment and return to normalcy is kind of lagging there. So, when you look across your
portfolio, do you see kind of different pace of margin improvement and return to normal, and do you expect your
refining results to reflect that throughout the year?
And then secondly, on the Toyota MOU you announced, there was a comment in the press release mentioning
that the MOU and the pursuit of hydrogen will leverage existing market positions and assets that Chevron has.
Can you maybe elaborate on that comment a bit, what market positions or assets or at least the types of market
positions and assets that the MOU will leverage? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Jason. I'll be real quick on the second one, because it's early days. It's an MOU, it's really to explore this
alliance is to work together to grow the hydrogen business in passenger vehicles and heavy-duty. You'd expect
that the focus would be around California, which makes sense and the reference to assets is like hydrogen fuel
dispensing at some of our service stations. So, that's the comment. More to come. We're very excited to partner
with a great company like Toyota on the fuel cell technology, and you'll hear more over time.
In terms of the regional differences, you're absolutely right. There are regional differences. If I contrast first West
Coast and Gulf Coast, yeah, actually, Gulf Coast is a little bit stronger, I mean Florida looks really pretty much
back to normal. West Coast, on track with gasoline and diesel, really has come on strong now the Southern
California resurgence earlier this winter has worked its way through. The rates are very low and you're seeing that
come back [ph] domestic (00:47:47) travel strong again in the Gulf Coast region, seeing it come back in
California.
What's a little bit weaker we're seeing on the West Coast is because the big airports in San Francisco and LA are
so heavy for international travel, that clearly is lagging. Now, hopefully it's coming soon after domestic travel. We
saw the announcement in Europe that fully vaccinated Americans could go to Europe this summer, so we'll just
see. That's hopefully not too far behind. We saw in China and Australia, the domestic travel fully recovered once
those countries got their arms around the virus, so I'm confident domestic travel will come back very quickly here
in this country. But again, international travel will lag a little bit and we'll just see.
Asia, Asia is big, it varies. Some countries have much better control of the virus than others, and then the excess,
some of the new refining capacity in China becomes relevant there. So, the US has strengthened for sure, as I
said earlier, with Winter Storm Uri, and you're seeing that in petrochemicals too. So, I do think second quarter,
third quarter are going to look better. It is a global market, so these markets do stay connected. Asia has also
recovered somewhat, and we'll see where the results are over the next few quarters. Thanks, Jason.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Sam Margolin
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

Hi. Thanks a lot. So, I just have one question, and I want to revisit this reinvestment topic because it seems pretty
influential right now. So, as you know, you field a lot of questions about your organic maintenance capital and
then anything inorganic is supposed to be accretive to some metric, whatever people choose, but I think is it fair
to say that with Noble, what we're seeing is a flexible strategy to reserve and production management if you're
generating surplus cash you're building capacity for inorganic adds to manage sustainability and we should think
about it as kind of a multi-faceted approach instead of this siloed point of view that people seem to be
shoehorning you into. Is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

I think so, Sam. Yeah, I mean, when we look at just the organic capital, and you say, again, we were $13 billionand-some-change, last year $14 billion, and we had planned to be at $20 billion each year pre-COVID, and you
make that comparison, but to not include the inorganic seems to not tell the whole story. And I think you saw that
in a lot of the reserve replacements, other numbers and you saw that in our Investor Day. Our ability to basically
get pretty close to the same production guidance five years out this year versus where we were last year is a
reflection of greater capital efficiency, but also the Noble transaction. Now – so that I agree with you.
Whether we do that again or not, that's a separate question. Again, we don't have to do that. We can sustain and
grow the enterprise. Our sustaining CapEx on the upstream side, excluding exploration and how we've defined, it
is about $9 billion, so we are above that. Of course we are, we're investing in Tengiz, which we know is going to
result in higher production and much stronger higher cash flow.

So, again, we showed a free cash flow growing 10% per year. So, I do understand all the questions. I think you
are hitting it. It's a little bit focusing on half of the story. We ought to look at the whole story. Of course, we're
managing the whole company, and again, keeping an eye on long-term value.

Q

Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.

Good morning, all. Two things. One, you haven't talked and I don't perceive this to be an issue, but because
based on your costs, I'm just wondering are you seeing any concern [ph] just with you (00:51:39) and talk a little
bit about OFS potential inflation both domestic and international, and then same sort of thing around any raw
material shortages and maybe include personnel there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, short answer is nothing at this point in time. Lots of talk about it, but we are not seeing requests for price
increases or that. In terms of inputs, certainly steel prices are up, so that would flow through to our wells and the
oil tubulars. And we are seeing this impacts more the downstream, trucker shortages, and so that in terms of
personnel, we're seeing that. I think that's in part the Amazon effect and all of the delivery UPS and the rest
pulling a lot of truckers off. So, we think that will work itself out. So, those are pretty minor and targeted. In terms
of general oilfield services inflation, not seeing it here in the US or internationally, but we're cognizant oil prices
are higher and we're certainly hearing the talk, just not seeing it on the ground.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neal Dingmann

Q

Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.

Okay. And then just lastly on, you talked about the new kind of carbonization project in California, I'm just
wondering, as you transact and sort of jump into more of those, is that going to be more sort of return-based or
what is sort of driving, as you see, opportunities in that? I just want to – maybe from a broader standpoint if I could
ask.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, we're very clear that our message and our goal is higher returns, lower carbon. And that's true in our
conventional business, and that's true in M&A, and how we walked away from Anadarko and how we did the
Noble transaction, and that's true in energy transition. When you look at hydrogen and carbon capture, yeah,
we're viewing those as growth businesses that can do both higher returns and lower carbon.

There are other parts of our energy transition strategy, lowering the carbon from our operations, which I
mentioned earlier, increasing renewable product, all of those also need to generate returns, so we're very clear
what we do in this space has to be good for the environment and good for shareholders, and so far, we're able to
accomplish both and we think activity will increase going forward.
