Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to
Chevron's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference
call is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation,
Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

All right. Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On
the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream, and Wayne Borduin, General
Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two.
Turning to slide three, an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were
$3.4 billion or $1.78 per diluted share. This was nearly $2 billion or roughly $1 per share higher than the same
period a year ago. The quarter included the impact of a non-recurring receivable write down, which was offset by
foreign exchange gains. A reconciliation of special items, foreign exchange and other non-GAAP measures can
be found in the appendix to this presentation.

Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $6.9 billion. Excluding working capital effects, cash flow from
operations was $7 billion. The working capital penalty in the current quarter was understated by the $270 million
receivable write down just mentioned as this was a non-cash item.
Year-to-date cash flow from operations has totaled $11.9 billion, about $3 billion more than a year ago. At quarter
end, debt balances stood at approximately $39 billion giving us a headline debt ratio of 20% and a net debt ratio
of 17%. During the second quarter, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends and we currently yield 3.6%.
Turning to slide four, in addition to the non-cash receivable write down impact, our second quarter cash from
operations position also reflected a discretionary U.S. pension contribution of $300 million. When these two
elements are taken into account to allow for an apples-to-apples comparison, underlying cash generation
improved between the first and second quarter by about $500 million.
This improvement reflected higher Brent prices of about $7.50 per barrel and higher WTI prices of about $5 per
barrel. Our upstream realizations did not fully capture the quarterly increase in global oil prices largely due to
portfolio mix effects surrounding the Brent/WTI differential.
We also saw lower Asia LNG spot prices during the quarter. Year-to-date affiliate dividends were $1.8 billion less
than earnings. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 billion and $6.2 billion year-to-date, in line with
our 2018 budget.
We had a 50% year-on-year improvement in operating cash flow from 2016 to 2017. We expect a similar
improvement trajectory from 2017 to 2018. We anticipate second half cash generation will reflect higher
production, strong upstream cash margins, additional proceeds from asset sales, and some reversals of working
capital requirements. These positives are expected to be offset only modestly by another discretionary U.S.
pension contribution.
Turning to slide five. This favorable outlook on cash flow, combined with our ongoing commitment to capital
discipline, enables us to initiate share repurchases targeted at $3 billion per year. Our financial priorities are
unchanged. We are generating cash, surplus to what we need to meet the first three of these. We increased our
annual dividend by 4% earlier in the year.
We continue to be very selective and disciplined in our investments and we have an advantaged portfolio and a
large captured resource base. We plan to ratably develop these resources within the $18 billion to $20 billion
capital range we previously indicated through 2020.
Our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger. We will take advantage of higher price periods, like we're seeing
now, to modestly reduce our debt level over time. We'll start repurchases in the third quarter. Going forward, we
will provide an update at the end of every quarter on our progress. We believe annual share repurchases of $3
billion can be sustained over most reasonable price scenarios.
Turning to slide six. Just a quick update on our portfolio optimization efforts. We have previously indicated our
intent to generate between $5 billion and $10 billion in targeted asset sale proceeds over the three-year period
2018 to 2020. We remain confident in this range.
On a year-to-date basis, we have had sales proceeds of approximately $700 million, primarily from the sale of our
upstream non-operated joint venture interest in the Elk Hills Field in California and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. Later this year, we expect to close the Southern Africa downstream transaction. When that happens, 2018
will be right on pace with our three-year target.
A few weeks ago we announced our decision to market our UK Central North Sea assets. As with any
transaction, we will only execute if we believe it is aligned with our strategic objectives and we receive good value.
Turning to slide seven. Second quarter 2018 after tax earnings were approximately $2 billion higher than second
quarter 2017. Special item impacts were comparable in the two periods and hence do not show up as a variance
bar in the aggregate for the enterprise. Favorable movements in foreign exchange positively impacted earnings
between the periods by $262 million.
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by approximately $2.3 billion
between periods, mainly on improved realizations and higher lifting. Downstream earnings, excluding foreign
exchange, decreased by about $400 million, mostly due to an unfavorable swing in timing effects; higher
operating expenses, largely due to planned turnaround activity; lower Asia margins and the absence of our
Canadian refining and marketing business.
The variance in the Other segment, excluding special items, was primarily the result of higher interest expense
since less interest is being capitalized currently compared to the prior year.
Turning to slide eight. This compares results for second quarter 2018 with first quarter 2018. Second quarter
results were approximately $230 million lower than the first quarter. For special items the second quarter included
the $270 million non-recurring receivable write down, while the first quarter included a $120 million asset
impairment. Foreign exchange impacts were a positive variance of $136 million between periods.
Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were essentially flat between the quarters.
Higher realizations were offset by higher operating expense and DD&A. Downstream earnings, excluding foreign
exchange improved by about $80 million reflecting higher volumes and stronger U.S. West Coast refining and
marketing margins.
The variance in the other segment largely reflected higher corporate charges and lower capitalized interest. As I
indicated last quarter, our guidance for the other segment is $2.4 billion in annual net charges and the quarterly
results are not ratable. With year-to-date charges of nearly $1.2 billion, we are trending in line with our earlier
guidance.
I'll now pass it on to Jay.

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

Thank you, Pat. On slide nine, second quarter 2018 production was an increase of 46,000 barrels a day from the
second quarter of 2017. Major capital projects increased production by 180,000 barrels a day as we continue to
ramp up multiple projects, most significantly Wheatstone and Gorgon.
Shale and tight production increased 91,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware
Basins in the Permian. Base declines, net of production from new wells such as those in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico
and Nigeria, were 51,000 barrels a day.

The impact of 2017 and 2018 asset sales reduced production by 77,000 barrels a day between the periods.
Entitlement effects reduced production by 54,000 barrels a day as both rising prices and lower spend reduced
cost recovery barrels.
Planned and unplanned downtime along with the impacts from external events reduced production by 43,000
barrels a day during the quarter. Overall, the first half 2018 production is up 4% relative to the first half of 2017.
Turning to slide 10. Second quarter production was 2.83 million barrels per day taking our year-to-date production
to 2.84 million barrels per day. Excluding the impact of 2018 asset sales, which is the middle bar, our year-to-date
production growth is 4.5% higher than the daily average production for full year 2017. This is in line with our
guidance.
As Pat mentioned last quarter, planned turnaround activity across multiple locations began in earnest in the
second quarter. The production impact from turnarounds in the second quarter was 67,000 barrels a day. We
expect heavier planned turnaround activity in the third quarter.
The production impact from 2018 asset sales was 15,000 barrels a day in the second quarter with a year-to-date
impact of 8,000 barrels a day. With the successful startup of Wheatstone Train 2, continued growth in the
Permian and ramp ups at Hebron, Stampede and Tahiti Vertical Expansion Project, we expect production to
further increase in the second half of this year. Our outlook for the full year is expected to be in the top half of our
guidance range even without normalizing for the impact of price at current levels.
Turning to slide 11. Chevron is now Australia's largest producer of LNG and the proud operator of five LNG trains
with a total installed liquefaction capacity of 24.5 million tons per year. Our facilities, along with available capacity
in other facilities in Northwest Australia, will enable us to monetize our world-class natural gas resource base for
decades to come.
Wheatstone Train 2 achieved first production in mid June. The ramp up has exceeded expectations as Train 2
reached nameplate capacity within weeks of startup. We've already exported the equivalent of six cargoes of
Train 2 production and we're planning to take a pit stop in the third quarter to remove the startup strainers.
Its companion plant, Wheatstone Train 1, has also been running well. The train has demonstrated nameplate
capacity and has now run 195 consecutive days without a day of downtime. We also successfully completed the
planned pit stop on Gorgon Train 2. The Gorgon pit stops have been successful and we're seeing improvements
in performance and reliability.
As a case in point, Gorgon Train 1 since its pit stop, has run more than 285 days without a day of downtime.
Combined net production from our operated LNG trains was 282,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the
second quarter. With Wheatstone Train 2 ramping up and Gorgon Train 2 back online, we're already seeing net
production approaching 400,000 barrels per day.
Let's turn to slide 12. I recently returned from a trip to Kazakhstan. Our base business at TCO is running well and
the FGP/WPMP project is progressing as guided towards first production in 2022. The project estimated to be
40% complete with preassembled pipe racks, process modules and a gas turbine generator all in transit from
yards in Kazakhstan, Korea and Italy. Six pipe rack modules have been successfully delivered to site,
demonstrating the operability of the delivery system and the receiving facilities.

Site work continues to focus on foundations, undergrounds, and infrastructure in preparation for module
installation. Major mechanical, electrical, and instrumentation contracts have been awarded. We also have three
drilling rigs operating on multi-well pads and drilling is ahead of schedule.
You'll recall back in March that I said 2018 is a critical year for execution. This is the first year of module
fabrication and site construction as well as initiation of the module transportation system.
With engineering approaching 85% complete and fabrication at 40% complete, we are seeing cost pressure on
the project. Site productivity remains a key driver of success for the project and is a major focus for our team.
Turning to the Permian on slide 13. Permian shale and tight production in the second quarter was 270,000 barrels
of oil equivalent per day, representing an increase of about 92,000 barrels a day, up 50% relative to the same
quarter last year.
Our development strategy continues to center around disciplined execution and capital efficiency. We're currently
running 19 rigs and our development program is progressing as planned. While activity levels are high in the
Permian, Chevron has not experienced supply shortages in the second quarter. And we're securing the dedicated
crews and materials needed to execute the plan we've previously described.
We continue to focus on well performance and the optimization of our well factory. This requires coordination and
planning, starting with our land position, running through the drilling, and completion strategy as well as the
design and construction of facilities. And it ends with the midstream arrangements to ensure that we bring
produced oil, gas, and NGLs to market at competitive realizations.
Let's turn to slide 14. We're currently operating eight development areas and participating in approximately 30
joint venture developments operated by others.
We continue to proactively manage and strengthen our land position. Year-to-date we've transacted 31,000 acres
through swaps, joint ventures, farm outs and sales. We've previously mentioned that some of the highest value
transactions are swaps that allow us to core up acreage and enable long length laterals.
As the land transaction example on the right depicts, coring up acreage provides an opportunity to double the
lateral length of each well and optimize facilities, which in turn lowers our unit development cost. In this case, the
acreage swap increased the number of long length lateral wells we can drill by approximately 600 and improve
the forecasted internal rate of return for each well by more than 30%.
Since 2016, we've increased our average lateral length per well in the Permian by approximately 35%. We'll
continue to look for opportunities to core up acreage and improve the capital efficiency of our Permian program.
Let's turn to slide 15. Last quarter, Mark discussed the value of being an integrated company and our strategy for
maximizing returns in the Permian. Chevron has secured firm transport capacity at competitive rates to move the
equivalent of nearly all of our forecasted 2018 and 2019 operated and NOJV take in kind oil production to multiple
markets, including the U.S. Gulf Coast.
As a result of these contractual arrangements and long term planning, this equivalent production is not materially
exposed to the Midland basis differential. Our share of NOJV oil production not taken in kind is approximately
20% of our Permian crude volumes.

We've previously mentioned that the pipeline takeaway capacity and production don't always move in perfect
lockstep. There will be periods of tightness and length. As an example, in June, we had more than 50,000 barrels
a day of excess takeaway capacity out of the Midland Basin which we monetize through purchases of third-party
volumes.
We expect that excess capacity to attenuate through the rest of the year as our production continues to grow.
Agreements are in place to access additional pipeline capacity in early 2019 in line with our production growth
forecast. In July, we utilized firm dock capacity in the Houston Ship Channel to gain access to world markets for
Permian sourced crudes. We have firm contractual arrangements in place to further increase that dock capacity in
2019.
Overall, we've exported more than 8 million barrels of liquids from the Gulf Coast in 2018, further demonstrating
our midstream's ability to batch, blend, trade and export to secure the highest value for our products.
We're developing processing arrangements for NGLs and we have flow assurance for natural gas to ensure that
production will not be impacted. We are moving forward with our development plans in the Permian and we do not
intend to slow down activity or divert capital.
Pat, back to you.

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay. Just a couple of closing comments about the first half and expectations for the remainder of the year. Cash
from operations excluding working capital is materializing as expected, given the market conditions, production
levels and asset reliability that we've achieved.
The picture for total cash flow in the second half looks promising as well. We expect second half upstream cash
margins to improve and our 2018 projected volume increases are back end loaded giving us confidence that our
full year production outlook is trending towards the upper half of the guidance range. In addition, we should see
some release of working capital and additional asset sales proceeds.
Capital spending is on budget for the first six months. And so in total, we have a very attractive offering for
investors: a growing dividend, assets that are strong cash generators, a healthy balance sheet and finally,
sufficient free cash flow to enable a share repurchase program. In short, we are delivering on all of our
commitments.
So that concludes our prepared remarks and we're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that
we have a lot of folks on the queue and so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. And
we'll certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered.
Jonathan, go ahead and open the lines please.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman
Sachs. Your question please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta

Q

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Hey, thank you very much and congratulations on the buyback. It's great to see you making this step. I want to
start there and see how you guys were framing the $3 billion number. How did you arrive at that being the right
level? And to your point about this being an every year number, how should we think about this? Should we think
of this as a base load fixed cost if you will on a go forward basis in any foreseeable price environment? Or is this
more of a flywheel dynamic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay, Neil, yeah. Thank you very much. Appreciate the question. You hit upon, in the way you asked the
question, some of the key words for us which really are, we do want this to be a sustainable element here. So we
obviously took a look at multiple price scenarios and we felt that this level of sustainability was – we could handle
this almost through any reasonable price environment there.
We pay attention to what expectations are in the market and you can see if you look at the futures market there's
a bit of a peak this year, next year and that maybe some downward trend. So obviously that's a scenario that we
took into account. And with that we felt that the $3 billion level was sustainable.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question
please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Philip M. Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Yes, good morning. I echo Neil's sentiment. Congratulations on the buyback. I guess, it's somewhat of a follow-up
question. You gave helpful color around cash from operations. Sounds like it supposed to be up 50% year-overyear I think is what you said. And so that'd be about $30 billion of CFO. If I look at that on a post dividend, post
CapEx basis, you'd have about $9 billion of post dividend free cash flow. And so it sounded like you said in your
prepared remarks, there's also maybe some desire to pay debt down a little bit. But just wondering how you think
about that. Obviously, a third of this incremental is going back to the shareholder. But are you trying to save
money for a rainy day? Or how do you think about that considering you also have asset sale proceeds coming in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Right. I think it's a great question and you're triangulating on the numbers quite accurately there. All I would like to
say just from the start, we'd like to get the cash in the door and see it before we over commit on it. So there might
be a bit of conservatism in here in how we started.

But if you step back and think about the price environment that we're in and the price environment that may be
expected that the market is telling us over the next couple of years that may be coming, which would be a lower
price environment, we think it's prudent at this point in time to strengthen the balance sheet a bit when commodity
prices are high. And so we do anticipate a little bit of debt paydown over the next period of time. We're certainly in
a comfortable position from a leverage standpoint. But paying it down a little bit, shoring up the balance sheet a
little bit, we think would be an improvement or we'd have willingness to go there to a small degree.
Obviously if you are building up cash a little bit and paying down debt a little bit, it gives you a bit of an insurance
policy when times get tougher to meet the commitments that you've already laid out there. And by that I mean the
commitments that you put out there in terms of dividend and also now the commitment we have around share
repurchases and the sustainability we hope to have around share repurchases. They don't have the same level of
commitment. Share repurchases are the fourth in our priorities. Dividends come first. But obviously we'd like to
have as much ratability and predictability around share repurchases as we can.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Philip M. Gresh

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Yeah, that makes sense. If I could ask a quick follow-up, just on the production guidance. You're comfortable at
the high end of the range despite – I think Jay said despite the entitlement effects, which I think in the second
quarter it was like a 2% year-over-year impact. So maybe you could just provide some color around, what do you
think is going better than your expectations? Is it all Permian or are there other things as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

So I think the primary thing that gives us confidence is that we started up Wheatstone Train 2 very late in the
second quarter. It has come up very cleanly and is running well. We continue to see growth in the Permian and
we have ramp ups going on as I said on a number of capital projects. We have some turnaround activity in the
third quarter, which will be a bit of a drag on production. But as we move through that and as we move into the
fourth quarter, overall with these new projects coming online and our relatively low base decline, we really feel
pretty comfortable about where we are on our production profile through the rest of the year barring unforeseen
events.

Q

Hey, guys. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


Q

Jay, did I hear you correctly? You're saying that you are seeing some cost pressure or sign of cost pressure? Can
you elaborate a little bit more in terms of how big is that really going to be a big problem or what kind of
magnitude we talking about? And where's the source of the cost pressure?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks, Paul. So we are seeing some cost pressure. We are now, as I said, approaching 85% complete on the
engineering. We're about 40% complete on fabrication. We're having a full year of construction in the field. Where
we have seen some cost pressure at this point in time, our engineering program has cost more than we would
have anticipated. We had some design quality issues, but also our productivity overall has been lower on
engineering than expected.
We've also seen some of our major contracts come in for field construction a little higher than what we expected.
When we put all that together, we are using more of the contingency at this point in time than we would have
expected or anticipated. And so that signals that we're seeing cost pressure on the project. We've talked about
getting through this season. We really need to see how the performance goes. There's a lot of important
milestones. The good things that are happening, the fabrication is really working well. We're seeing high quality
come out of the modules themselves as they're being completed and shipped to Tengiz.
We've successfully tested the logistics system and we have delivered modules all the way to site. So those things
are all working quite well. But what we need to do is we're 40% complete on this project. It's large; it's complex
and we've used more of the contingency at this point than we would have expected. So that tells us we have cost
pressure on this project. We'll continue to assess it and we'll update you accordingly as we need to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

And at what point that you will be more certain whether that you have to raise your overall budget? Is it six months
from now? Where's the, maybe the critical path that you need to pass in order for you to know whether that you
will be able to stay within the budget or it's going to be higher?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

We continue to assess our performance, Paul, as we move through the project. This is a five, six-year project,
overall duration. So we're still relatively early in the project. The site productivity is really going to be important.
And as we go through this year and can really assess where we are and look at that site productivity, it is a fullcourt press in the field to really make sure we are making the progress, but in making that progress, using the
number of man hours and the resources that we expected.
So we're very focused on the timely delivery of engineering and engineered design and bulk materials. We want
to make sure that we've got our crews ready, that the workforce planning is in place and that we have efficient
support of our workforce so that we get the most out of that crew. So it's hard to put a definite time on it. We will
continue to monitor our performance. We build these into our business plan. At this point, I do not see it impacting
our guidance of $18 billion to $20 billion. And we'll keep you updated as we gain more information.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


Q

Okay. My second question, Jay when you guys do economic analysis do you primarily use the real price or are
you using the nominal price as the base case?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

The real price of oil do you mean?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

We have a corporate price forecast which we use as our basis for our economic assumptions. But more
importantly, we also test our business plan against both higher and lower price scenarios to make sure that we
have a robust plan that takes into account. The one thing we do know with certainty is that we cannot predict the
oil price. So we want a plan that really is able to respond and adjust accordingly, with options, for whatever the
price turns out to be.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

I'm sorry that I probably didn't make myself clear. When I say real price means that the price adjust for inflation.
Do you build in an inflation factor whatever is the price deck that you use? Or you just use a nominal flat price in
your assumption? So when you guys, previously saying that, Tengiz will be a $60 or low $60 Brent price would be
generating a 10% return or 15% return, is that the price is based on inflation adjusted or nominal?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

I mean, it's based on inflation adjusted. I mean we look at what we expect prices to be because the cost out
estimates that we're putting together have those kind of components built in. But when we're taking the project to
evaluation, when we're doing the final investment decision, we look at a whole host of price scenarios and we look
at both nominal and real outcomes.
What would you have to believe to have a 10% rate of return in a nominal sense? What would you have to have
in a real sense? So we look at the economics and judge the value of the projects based on multiple price
scenarios. But when we're actually putting out an FID kind of number, it is our best estimate of what that cost at
that point in time will be.

Lynch. Your question please.

Doug Leggate

Q

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Thank you. Good morning, everybody and thanks, Joe (sic) [Jay] for getting on the call. I've got two questions if I
may. I guess the first one is an upstream question. When you laid out the Analyst Day back in March, obviously
you kept your guidance through 2020. And if we take, Pat, what you said about the buyback being sustainable, it
seems at least on our numbers in the current oil price environment, you have got a lot more headroom in terms of
surplus cash.
But I'm curious, what are your intentions post 2020? Should we expect the current level of spending to be
sustained? Or is that headroom to allow for let's say another step up in project visibility as we go beyond for
example Tengiz as we go beyond 2020? I've got a quick follow-up please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. So, Doug, I think I'd just start and say we feel good about the $18 billion to $20 billion range out through
2020 because we can see our way forward that far with the quality of the resource base we have, the production
profile that we've got laid out for the Permian and other unconventionals, our ability to take what is a relatively less
mature asset base like LNG and debottleneck it and see continued value growth there.
We have a whole series of investments that we can see lined out that our current portfolio gives us opportunity to
develop economically. And that's why we feel comfortable about the $18 billion to $20 billion range.
When you get beyond 2020, we really will have to have a review of other incremental projects that we would like
to bring online. At some point, we believe that there will be the opportunity to add deepwater investments for
example. Those are competing now or they're working to get their cost structure down so that they can compete
better in the portfolio. That time that will come. We've said in the past that we want to be ratable in terms of how
many we bring those on at what timeframe and what sort of pacing we do.
So that's all stuff that we will put together as we're looking at our 2019 to 2021 plan. And it's all information that
we will try to come out and provide a little bit more guidance for when we get to our Security Analyst Meeting in
March of 2019. But for now, I think the key message is $18 billion to $20 billion, that's the capital program, that's
the capital discipline that we're living within.

Q

Thanks, Pat. Jay, maybe I can follow up with you specifically then on another potential source of cash. Because
you guys have obviously got tremendous flexibility with the Permian, but you're also very early in your $5 billion to
$10 billion disposal plan. And since you laid that out, the oil price has obviously recovered quite a bit. So I guess,
what I'm asking, Jay, is is there upside to your disposal target? How has the change in oil price changed your
view of what's core within the portfolio? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.

I would say that as we look at assets that are going to be part of our portfolio of work, we tend to look at assets
that are approaching end of life or either very early in life. So early in life would be resource opportunities that we
have that just don't compete for capital in the portfolio. They may be economic, quite economic but they don't
compete for capital. We're trying to be very disciplined about what projects we invest in and only invest in the top
part of our queue.
The projects that are very late in life tend to have limited resource potential left for us and those are the ones
we're putting out there. The higher prices certainly help, but I wouldn't change our guidance at this point in time.
This is going to be a pretty ratable program. And it's a pretty normal part of our operation to continue to look at
properties as they move through their lifecycle and decide when do they need to exit the portfolio. Our overall
focus on all of this, we're not driving to a production target. We are driving to improve our returns and lead the
industry in our returns on the upstream assets.

Q

Hi, everyone and thanks very much. Jay, very positive comments on the operations in Australia essentially
reaching nameplate capacity already. And, obviously, very long duration runs on several of the trains. I guess, my
question is given this performance, how should we think about utilization rates in 2019 on the LNG facilities,
recognizing that obviously some maintenance still needs to be done, but that there are probably some
debottlenecking opportunities in the near-term that you might be able to take advantage of?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Yes, we have not issued any formal guidance around this yet. We're going through the business plan now when
we really develop that. But I would say that we took all the knowledge from the Gorgon Train 1 and applied that to
2 and 3. We've gone through the pit stops now. So we're really pretty comfortable with where these trains are.
And we just need to get some run time and do the analysis to see where the opportunities are for further
expansion. One of the best ways to extend the capacity of these trains, of course, is just keeping them fully online
and fully utilized and so that's our primary focus at the moment.
Wheatstone is a very similar story. Train 1 started up; we had a pretty clean startup. But taking all those lessons
learned Train 2 has started up very cleanly and at this point in time we do not have any anticipation of taking
those down. So we may have from time to time as we've said before some of these small pit stops if we see
economically driven opportunities to enhance performance as we've done.
But overall I think a lot of the – other than routine maintenance, a lot of the known shutdowns at this point in time
are behind us. We will get into a regular rotation of shutdowns as all major trains do. And that's on a three or four
year cycle as we get these. And we want to have them staggered out. But that's all being sorted out in our
business plan and for now, we would expect to see some pretty good sustained runs on these trains.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, Jay, could you comment on timing on first production at
Bigfoot and whether you are actively engaged in restarting production in the PZ?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, so at Bigfoot, we still expect to see production started later this year. We have made good progress. We
got the platform successfully installed and storm safe as you know early in the first quarter of this year. The
drilling program is underway. We're completing the first wells and we're moving through and just about to bring
buyback gas into the facility to start the final commissioning. So later in this year we will expect to see production
at Bigfoot. We've already run, in fact, some of the second riser just to make sure loop currents aren't a factor for
us in that program.
As we look at the PZ that, of course, is an ongoing issue that the two governments are working to resolve. Our
focus is on making sure that we're keeping the facilities in a ready to restart mode. We're very focused on asset
integrity and preservation types of activities.
We've also done a lot of engineering and used this time of downtime to model not only a more comprehensive
reservoir set of models, but also the surface facilities and really identified all the opportunities of low hanging fruit
to optimize the flow once we get the facilities back online. So I think there's a lot of good opportunity for us when it
restarts. We remain ready to go and, of course, we'll support the governments as they work towards resolution.

Hey, Roger.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

If we could, Jay, maybe come back to the Midland Delaware Basin, the takeaway. And then, you've been, over
the last several quarters, exceeding the guidance range that was laid out at the Analyst Day. So I was just
curious, as you think about the capacity to take away, both on the oil and gas side, the fact you're running ahead
of the guidance range, does that create any risks?

And then, the second part of my question is, as you move non-operated or non-produced barrels, that 50,000
barrels a day and replace them with your own, how does that flow through in terms of performance? I would
assume better cash capture, cash margin capture on your own barrels than third-party, but I was just curious how
that works out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, I'll take the first question or the part of the question. The higher production that we're seeing from our
operations is taken into account. Our Midstream Group and our business unit, they're in daily conversation about
where we are, what our updated forecasts look like, so that we don't catch anyone by surprise. The Midstream
Group has done an outstanding job of working with various suppliers of services in the area for our takeaway
capacity. We have adopted the strategy and our focus is on maximizing returns from the Permian and that's what
drives all of our efforts.
So where we have had opportunities to not invest our capital, but rather contract for service, like pipelines and
takeaway capacity, or gas lines and things, where we can tariff through someone else's capital at a better rate,
we've chosen to do so. But that means we have to be very coordinated with all these various suppliers to ensure
the capacity is in place and accommodating our growth plans.
So at this point in time, we look very good through 2018 and 2019. We just will continue to monitor this. There's
periods of tightness, periods of excess capacity. And we look to take opportunity to acquire other crudes and
move them through those lines when the opportunities present themselves in the form of a differential exceeding
the tariff.
I do think, in terms of the – when we think about the NOJV, you almost have to think of the upstream produces
into the Midland Basin, into the Midland area. And then our Midstream takes crude from the Midland area and
moves it to markets. And that's our crude and others' crude.
So it's really a big machine, but it's hard to say one specific barrel moves through the system. It's more of a
commercial arrangement and equivalent volumes. Our goal is to make sure that we are getting the maximum
returns for the barrels that we produce whether they're non-operated or operated barrels as we move those to the
various markets.
The other thing that our Midstream has done that's been really helpful is not just get pipeline capacity out of the
basin to the various markets, but then they have also made arrangements so that we can move this, as we said,
across the dock into ships and access world markets as well. And so, it really lets us take a forward look at those
markets and adjust our offtake as we need to maximize our realizations.

And I would just add it's one of the benefits of being an integrated company, and it's also one of the benefits of
being a company that focuses on a longer term plan. We've been under this plan of a 20 rig rate in the Permian
for quite some time and all of these precursors have been lined out.


Q

Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP Paribas.
Your question please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Theepan Jothilingam
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas

Q

Yes. It's Theepan. A couple of questions actually. Firstly, I think you gave guidance at the Analyst Day on the
headwinds in the cash flow of somewhere between $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. So I just wanted to know whether
that guidance is still valid and how much of those headwinds have been consumed in the first half.
And then the second question, I think we've been given an update in terms of the uncon business, particularly for
the Permian. But I was just wondering how the rest of the unconventional business, the Duvernay, Argentina is
looking as one reviews the last six months. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. I can take them in order I think. So yeah, good question about the headwinds. So year-to-date, so through
this first six months we're sitting at combined headwinds of about $3.6 billion. The guidance that I had given back
in March was between $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion. Actually I think that is still good guidance. It may in fact come
in a little bit lower – I mean a little bit towards the low end of the range.
What we're seeing here with higher prices is that the deferred tax headwind that we thought would materialize at
lower prices is really almost turning into, essentially turning into a tailwind here at higher prices. And that's exactly
what you would expect. So bottom line, somewhere between $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion but probably closer to the
bottom end of that range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

And as far as our other unconventional activities, we continue to see very good progress in all three of the assets.
I'll just walk through them one at a time. The three rig – we've increased from two to three rigs down in Argentina.
Work very well with our operator YPF. We are seeing continued improvement in our performance down there. The
economic returns are looking very strong.
I think what's really important in Argentina is as they continue to deal with some of their situation maintaining an
open market will be an important watch point for us as we continue to move forward with our operations in the
Vaca Muerta. We also have a field called El Trapial which was a conventional field up in the northern part of that
area. And we are planning to do an eight-well pilot for the unconventional potential under El Trapial. And there is
a lot of expectation that that may also prove to be a good area for us from an unconventional sense.
We've restarted our drilling campaign in the Marcellus. We took a couple of year holiday just to reduce our capital
during the last couple of years, but we're now moving back into operation there. And the initial results coming out
of the Marcellus is we've picked up right where we left off and continued our march to lower our unit development
and operating costs. So pretty pleased with what we're seeing in the Marcellus and Utica areas.

And then finally up at Kaybob Duvernay in Canada, we're also seeing good performance from our crews up there.
We have moved from largely a land tenure and assessment or appraisal drilling mode into our first factory mode
and have our first development area. That's about 55,000 acres that we started on in November of 2017. So as
we shift from moving rigs around and appraisal drilling to actually development drilling, we expect to see that
continued improvement in performance there.
One of the things that has been really successful for us over the last two or three years has been bringing these
various teams together. They meet on a regular basis; best practices are shared between the different areas. So
while they all have different characteristics, there is far more in common than there is different. And the
techniques, the best practices, the use of data analytics, just a lot of the experience that we gain on a daily basis,
instead of just being in one area now, we're deploying that across all four. And it doesn't just flow from the
Permian outward. Things like zipper fracking actually came from the Marcellus into the Permian. And so we see
that leveraging of knowledge and experience is quite powerful and very valuable for us.

Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Q

Thanks for taking the question. As you're working to expand Gorgon, I know that the Australian government is
prioritizing more domestic gas supply, particularly for the eastern states in the country. And how do you kind of
balance out your higher export demand with the fact that there is a brewing shortage domestically in the market?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Well we'd love to sell them LNG to start with. But what's really important to Australia, as with any country, is
energy security. You always want to make sure your country has a sufficient supply of clean, affordable, reliable
energy source. And so in the West Australia, there is no pipeline; there is no way to transport gas from the west to
the east other than through LNG.
We continue to produce LNG. We have extensive gas resources in the west; 50 trillion cubic feet of gas that's
Chevron equity gas. Our focus is on making sure we have domestic gas plants at both Gorgon and Wheatstone.
We have plenty of capacity to supply the West Australia market.
But we also are really focused on making sure that we move and monetize that gas resource to the various
markets that are demanding it. So at this point I don't see the East Coast problems having any impact on either
the expansion or the delivery from West Australia.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pavel S. Molchanov

Q

Okay. And a quick follow-up on your monetization plans. You mentioned some of the upstream assets. Given the
very hot demand these days for Permian midstream capacity, is that something that you would consider including
in your divestment planning?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A
We don't really have midstream assets per se in the Permian area. We have been focusing on the upstream.
That's where we see the highest value, the highest returns. And our takeaway capacity in the midstream
processing like gas plants, NGLs is provided by third parties.
