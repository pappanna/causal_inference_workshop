Operator: Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to
Chevron's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode.
After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session, and instructions will be given at that
time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr.
Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead, sir.

Wayne Borduin
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thank you, Audra, and welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the
call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are
available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2.
I'll turn over to Pierre.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Wayne. Second quarter was a challenging one for the company. Financial results included $4.9 billion in
special item net charges and a foreign exchange loss of over $400 million. Excluding special items and FX, the
quarter resulted in a $3 billion loss or $1.59 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in
the appendix of this presentation.
Cash flow from operations was about $100 million, and total capital spending was $3.3 billion, including about
$300 million for the Puma Energy Australia acquisition. Asset sale proceeds for the quarter were about $1.5
billion, related to the sale of our Azerbaijan and Colombia Upstream businesses. Our dividend was flat with the
prior quarter, and we maintained a strong balance sheet.
Turning to slide 4. In the second quarter we recorded over $5 billion in impairments and other non-cash charges.
The charges were triggered by the uncertain operating environment and outlook in Venezuela, a lower oil and gas
price forecast due to the anticipated economic impacts of COVID-19, and severance accruals resulting from our
transformation initiative.
While we are disappointed by the impairment in Venezuela, we intend to maintain a presence in the country and
resume normal operations one day.
The price related impairments were primarily related to Stampede, a non-operated field in the Gulf of Mexico,
conventional operations in the Permian, and various producing assets in Asia and Africa. These charges were
partially offset by a gain on asset sales and various tax items.

Turning to slide 5. We remain on track to meet our revised guidance for 2020 capital and operating cost
reductions. Organic CapEx in the second quarter was $3 billion, already at a run rate 40% below the original
budget. Full year capital guidance remains unchanged at $14 billion, as we will need to see sustained economic
recovery and much lower inventories before considering raising activity levels.
Operating costs are also trending lower, in line with our expectation of $1 billion savings compared to 2019.
Organizational design from our transformation efforts is complete. Employee selections are underway. And we
expect to be operating under our new model in the fourth quarter, delivering additional run rate savings next year.
Turning to the next slide. Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're on track to grow the dividend for the
33rd straight year. Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was low due to the market environment,
which was partially offset by lower cash CapEx and asset sale proceeds.
Higher debt this quarter included our successful bond issuance in May. Our balance sheet remains strong with a
net debt ratio below 17%, well ahead of our competitors.
Turning to slide 7. Second quarter earnings were lower due to a swing of over $6 billion in special items and FX
versus the same period last quarter. Adjusted Upstream earnings decreased primarily, due to lower prices,
including greater differentials to benchmark crudes due to market volatility, and reduced lifting volumes, primarily
due to curtailments and prior Upstream asset sales. Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased primarily due to
lower sales volumes to match decreased demand and unfavorable timing effects.
Turning to slide 8. Compared to the first quarter, second quarter adjusted earnings decreased by over $5 billion.
Adjusted Upstream earnings decreased by about $3 billion, primarily due to lower liquids realizations, lower sales
volumes mainly due to curtailments, and an unfavorable swing in timing effects.
Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased by almost $2 billion, primarily due to an unfavorable swing in timing
effects, lower margins, and lower sales volumes. Chevron's refinery system ran reliably during the quarter with
crude utilization well below capacity due to lower demand.
The Other segment decreased primarily due to an unfavorable swing in accruals for stock based compensation.
I'll now pass it over to Jay.

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Pierre. On slide 9, second quarter oil equivalent production, excluding asset sales, was flat compared to
a year ago. During the quarter, increased Permian shale and tight production and higher entitlement effects were
offset primarily by curtailments in turnarounds. The curtailments were at the low end of our guidance range, as
prices recovered from historic lows late in the quarter.
I'm really proud that our employees have kept our Upstream operations running safely and reliably during this
global pandemic. With all of the challenges of moving people and equipment, and of course personal concerns at
home, our employees have risen to the occasion to deliver the energy needed in recovering economies.
Turning to the Permian. We're making disciplined choices to balance short term cash flow, while preserving long
term value. In response to the current market conditions, we quickly reduced our flexible capital program across
the portfolio. And in the Permian, expect quarterly capital spend in the second half of the year to be about 75%
lower than the first quarter. As of July, we've reduced our operated rig count to four, with one completion crew.
Although the level of activity in the Permian has rapidly changed, our focus on efficiency has not. By the end of
this year, we expect to double the lateral feet drilled per rig compared to 2018. With lower capital investment and
our approving efficiency, we still expect to be free cash flow positive this year at strip prices.
As shown on slide 11, the short term outlook for Permian production has changed as a result of the lower capital
spending. After curtailments in May and June, we're back to full production and expect second half production to
be in line with the first half.
At current activity levels, we expect production to decline about 6% to 7% in 2021. Early next year, we'll update
2021 production guidance for the Permian and the rest of Chevron's Upstream portfolio.
As stated in our first quarter 10-Q, we expect lower capital spending to result in the demotion of proved,
undeveloped reserves, primarily in the Permian. These barrels may be rebooked as proved reserves when
funding and activity levels increase.
The near term production profile for the Permian has changed, but our long term view of the assets' attractiveness
has not. With our scale, efficient factory drilling, and royalty advantage, we believe we're well positioned to
maximize returns and deliver value.
Turning to TCO. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, we continue to make progress with our future
growth wellhead pressure management project at Tengiz. And the project is now 79% complete. Offsite
fabrication is complete, and all modules have now departed Korea. Our logistics system is working well, and we
expect to receive all the remaining modules in Tengiz this year.
The remaining project scope is primarily the construction and commissioning work in Tengiz. We made excellent
progress on-site construction through the end of last year and the first quarter of this year.
In the second quarter, as a result of the COVID pandemic, we reduced our construction workforce to 20% of plan.
As a result, overall construction progress has been impacted, due to the limited construction workforce.
Let's turn to the next slide. TCO is working hard to mitigate the risk from the pandemic by closely coordinating
with health experts and regulatory agencies to implement safeguards that protect our workforce.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2020, the project team is focused on remobilizing the Tengiz construction
workforce and completing the final sealift. A return-to-work plan for about 20,000 FGP construction personnel is
set to begin in August, and we will continue, as conditions allow.
Critical path activities, such as the delivery and installation of the first two pressure boost compressor modules,
remain on track. Foundations and access roads are complete, and the team is preparing to receive, restack, and
install these modules.
With the high field productivity and progress over the winter, we were ahead of schedule, but now have limited
schedule float remaining. Our ability to complete the remobilization and sustain the construction workforce
through the pandemic is key to limiting further impacts to the project. We're focused on safely progressing the
project, and we expect to be able to provide more specific updates to project cost and schedule early next year.


Now I'll give it back to Pierre. Thanks.

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Jay. Slide 14 highlights some recent announcements. On July 1, we safely started up production in the
Partitioned Zone and completed the first export this week. Also we closed the acquisition of Puma Energy
Australia. These assets will integrate with our refining and marketing value chain in Asia-Pacific and extend the
valued Caltex brand in the region.
Earlier this month, we signed an agreement with Algonquin, a leader in renewable power generation, to codevelop renewable power projects that will support our operations. Initial project assessments will be focused on
the Permian, Argentina, Kazakhstan, and Australia.
Turning to the next slide. Last week, we announced we had reached an agreement to acquire Noble Energy. As
necessary regulatory and approval steps progress, we've also launched our integration planning efforts.
Representatives from both companies are meeting today to kick off the planning discussion. And we look forward
to integrating Noble's complementary assets, people, and capabilities into Chevron.
Looking ahead, we anticipate a straightforward and fast integration. Our internal transformation efforts should help
us efficiently integrate the new organization and achieve our synergy targets.
Now, looking forward on Slide 16. In the third quarter, we expect production curtailment of about 150,000 barrels
of oil equivalent per day, primarily due to the OPEC Plus agreement.
Planned turnarounds, primarily in Australia, the Gulf of Mexico, and Canada, are expected to impact production
by about 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes an extension of the turnaround at Gorgon until
early September. In Australia, we expect LNG contract pricing to be lower due to the three- to six-month lag with
oil prices.
Based on our current outlook, full year net production is expected to be roughly flat with 2019, including the
effects of curtailment. And TCO co-lending is expected to be about $2 billion for the year.
In Downstream, turnaround activity is estimated to have an after-tax earnings impact of $100 million to $200
million. We expect our other segment earnings and distributions less affiliate income to be in line with prior
guidance, excluding the impact on this quarter's special items.
Turning to our last slide. With health, economic, and social crises all happening at the same time, this was a
challenging quarter for Chevron and its stakeholders and a reminder of the importance of the S in ESG. We're
proud of the work we're doing with social investments in our communities, pay equity for our employees, and our
supply chain spend with women and minority owned businesses. You can read about this and more in our
sustainability report, which was published in the second quarter.
But with concerns for the health of our loved ones, economic uncertainty in our communities, an expectation for
racial justice and equal opportunity, we know that there's more work to do.
On the right of the slide is the company's five-point action plan in response to current market conditions. We're
proud of how our employees are executing this plan and delivering on what we can control. We entered this crisis
in a better place than our competitors. And we intend to exit stronger and more valuable for all of our
stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Wayne.

Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that
we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if necessary. We'll do
our best to get all of your questions answered.
Audra, please open the lines.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Gresh at JPMorgan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Philip M. Gresh

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Yes. Hi. Good morning. First question is just kind of tying together the commentary on the Permian for next year
being down 6% to 7% with your CapEx commentary that you've provided. Which I think in the past, you've said $3
billion quarterly run rate for second half CapEx on a C&E basis, not on a cash CapEx basis. So is the Permian
commentary consistent with just keeping that CapEx at that type of run rate in the second half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, so we had an approved budget of $20 billion. When we announced our market response plan and then
updated it at our earnings call, we reduced the full year to a $14 billion average but a run rate of $12 billion,
essentially, for the second half of the year.
Well, we achieved that a quarter early. So if you back out the Puma Energy Australia acquisition, we were at $3
billion already in the second quarter. And that's obviously at that $12 billion annual run rate, which is a 40%
reduction. And embedded in that are the reductions that Jay referred to in the Permian and operating at the
current four rigs and one completion crew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Philip M. Gresh

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Okay. Got it. So you keep it at that level in 2021 for a 6% to 7% decline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, yeah, so I'm sorry. So yeah, we haven't given capital guidance for 2021. We're in the middle of our planning
process. We'll do our normal disclosure and sharing of what our capital budget is for 2021 in December when
we've completed our plan, and the board has approved the plan.
What we are showing is just an outlook based on current activity level. We early on guided to Permian production
being about 20% lower on the exit rate from relative to our investor day guidance. And actually, we're doing a bit
better than that. So that would have taken us down a little bit lower than what you're seeing on that chart.
And then executing this plan and staying at this activity level. Yes, we project that kind of guidance. We're not
giving production guidance. There's a lot of time between now and then.
We're just sort of showing what the outlook looks like if activity levels stay at the same level. It'll depend on what
the economic recovery is, what inventory level is. A number of factors will determine what our activity level will be
in the Permian going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Philip M. Gresh

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Okay. Got it. My second question just would be on Gorgon. There have been some media reports out there
talking about some operational hiccups on Train 2 and getting that restarted. I think you were planning in midJuly. It sounds like you may be as early as September at this point.
But could you just elaborate on what's happening there? What the root cause of this delay is? And what it would
mean for being able to meet contractual obligations? I think you're about 80% contracted at Gorgon. But just any
color there would be helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, Phil, I'll take that one. So our fundamental concern is operating safely and reliably. And we're always going
to take decisions in alignment with that.
As part of our normal operations, we take trains down for turnarounds to do inspections and maintenance. And
during the Train 2 turnaround, what we found in the Train 2 propane heat exchangers, or kettles some call them,
we saw some weld defects.
So we developed a repair procedure and are progressing well on those repairs. We expect them to be fully
accomplished here in the near term. And we expect to have the train up and running in early September.
All the other planned work for the turnaround has already been completed. So the focus really is just on
completing these repairs to the propane heat exchangers.
We're going to use the findings from what we saw in Train 2 to plan the appropriate actions for Train 1 and Train
3. But at this point, Train 1 and 3 run normally as expected. And we've actually seen good stable operations out of
them.
So at this point, there have not been challenges in delivering on our commitments. And I don't anticipate that as
we look forward.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gammel
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Thanks very much. I guess first question I have for Pierre is, it was obviously a pretty tough quarter. But I wasn't
necessarily expecting cash from operations ex working capital to be negative. So can you address if there's
anything in the quarter that is sort of a one-off item that affected the cash number? Or is this just purely the result
of the core price and margin environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

So look, it was a challenging quarter. We did – to put it in perspective, we had a big beat last quarter, and we had
a miss this quarter. And one of the primary drivers we talked about last quarter and – or we talked about this
morning is our timing effects. And as you know, Jason, these are effects that benefit us in a falling oil price
environment and reverse in a rising oil price environment. And we saw that.
Obviously, prices declining in the first quarter and rising in the second quarter. And some of those effects do roll
through cash, because it's essentially going through our COGS. And it's a timing difference between when COGS
are being recognized relative to the underlying margin.
In addition to that, look, we had very volatile industry conditions, as you know. We had historically low prices at
times. Very volatile pricing.
And there were times where we did not capture what the benchmark crudes were indicating. And that was true in
the US in certain times with the calendar roll and the physical differentials, which we're adjusting very quickly. But
it was a very fast moving situation.
And then it was true outside the US for certain crudes. CPC blend at times was being discounted more heavily
versus Brent. Some of our West Africa crudes also were being discounted more heavily versus Brent than is
typical in a normal trading pattern.
And then we ran much lower utilization on the Downstream than is typical. Again, we had unprecedented demand
decreases, rapidly changing demand decreases. We were managing our refinery system to be in synch with the
demand. In the US, we ran – our crude utilization was 55%, which is well below what the capacity is. And to just
point out how extraordinary the conditions were in the second quarter. So that resulted in much lower volumes
than we typically would sell, and the resulting impact on margin.

The last thing I'd point out on earnings, and it's not a cash effect, is we do make accruals for stock based
compensations for all employees that have stock based compensation. And in the first quarter, that was a
favorable, and there was a swing.
So there's no doubt there's a non-cash element in the earnings. But the realizations, volumes, and aspects of the
timing also roll through cash. There was nothing I would say that was unusual, except the industry conditions that
were very unusual and extraordinary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gammel

Q

Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

No, thanks. I appreciate that, Pierre. Hopefully we won't ever see another quarter like this past one.
Second question is for Jay. Jay, this is the first time we've been able to speak with you since the Noble acquisition
was announced. I was hoping you might be able to give us your view of the quality and fit of those assets into the
Chevron portfolio? And specifically interested in the Permian acreage and your view on the East Med [East
Mediterranean] and the potential for future expansion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, thank you, Jason. We're obviously excited to have these assets join our portfolio. I think they're a really
nice set of assets, and they have an excellent fit with us.
In the case of the Eastern Med and the DJ Basin, we see two new scale – operations of scale that fit quite well
into our capabilities. We've worked for many years in the Middle East. And this is a nice edition to our current
portfolio.
In Colorado, we're excited to have an entry into the DJ that has such a long running room and good returns.
In the Permian, it's a nice add-on to our existing Permian operations in the Delaware basin. And about 90,000
acres coming into our portfolio, so we see good synergies there.
And then there are other assets in the Noble portfolio that will be nice assets to have. We'll continue to start
evaluating their performance. And just on balance, I'm happy with what's coming into the portfolio. I think it's going
be a really good fit. And there's a lot of good people in the Noble organization as well. We're looking forward to
bringing them into the family.

Morning, Devin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Devin J. McDermott

Q

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

So my first one is on TCO and just following up on some of the prepared remarks, Jay, that you had. And when
we think about the critical path here for the back half of 2020 and really into the next few years, you noted that
you have all the materials on-site to achieve that critical path.
But I wanted to ask specifically on the remobilization of the workforce. And how you're planning that to continue to
achieve execution on the critical path items, as we think about the overall project timeline? Any risk of delay? Just
a little bit more detail on how you're thinking about the interplay there with the critical path and remobilization of
workforce?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, thank you. Well, as I said, we made great progress over the winter time. And we're actually building ahead
of the schedule.
With the modules being completed on time and coming to us, they're coming to us complete with good quality and
dimensionally accurate, so they're meeting all of our expectations. And we expect to have the sealift finished this
year. Those are all key elements in maintaining schedule on the project.
From the workforce on the ground standpoint, Kazakhstan, like many other countries, is going through a
significant impact from the COVID. And so as part of our precautions, we demobilized to about 20% as the
planned workforce in the second quarter. That's about 20,000 workers that we need to bring back.
During June and July, we've been doing a crew change on those people that were remaining in Tengiz. And that's
given us a chance to test the systems that we've been putting in place. And those involve testing people at their
point of origin before they return to Tengiz.
Once they get to Tengiz, we have isolation camps set up, so that we can put people in isolation. Even with
negative tests, we still put them in isolation to – effective quarantine period. Then retest before they're allowed to
progress to Tengiz.
We're using a pod strategy, where we keep groups of workers together but isolated from other groups. And that
includes where they live, transportation, how they take meals. Trying to make sure we have sufficient mitigations
in place to protect that workforce. Our fundamental concern is the safety of the workforce and making sure that
we can sustain operations as we rebuild.
We expect that mobilization to take place over about a four-month period. But clearly that's going be dependent
upon the environment in Kazakhstan as well as just the difficulty of moving people internationally for a project at
this scale. And we'll take the learnings as we've done the crew change and continued to adapt as we move
forward into the remobilization.
Our focus continues on critical path activities, but we've got to also work off a large volume of work that didn't get
done in the second quarter.
And so to really – we expect some degree of impact. But to really be able to give you any kind of an updated
forecast on cost or schedule, we need to see how this remobilization goes. We need to see how we're able to
sustain people at work within the pandemic. And we'll be able to update you I think more effectively probably in
the first quarter of next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Devin J. McDermott

Q

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful. And a second question is one relating to the US selection in the short term
and a longer term part.
And the shorter term part is there's a lot of discussion around potential permitting or leasing changes, specifically
on federal lands and waters. And one, just how you're thinking about managing that potential risk, given the large
presence in the Gulf of Mexico.
And the second part of the question is the longer term piece. There's also some discussion around things like
clean energy standard or investments from the federal government into things like clean hydrogen over time.
And just how you're thinking about managing the business from an investment strategy longer term to position
Chevron for this potential shifting regulatory environment? And maybe weave in the recent announcement on the
renewables partnership with Algonquin and how that fits into longer term strategy as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Sure, Devin. I think I'll start and let Jay address the question on federal leasing.
I mean at the highest level, look, we work well at the federal, state, and local levels in this country with
governments of both parties. And of course we work with governments of different parties all around the world.
Energy is essential as the economy and the world economies recover from this pandemic. And jobs in oil and gas
are good paying jobs and are a big part of the economy in a number of states in the US and a number of
countries around the world. We think whichever government, in the US or another country, the economy will be a
priority coming out of this. And we think energy will be a big part of that.
We're a very responsible company, including our commitment to ESG, which I referred to, and actions we're
taking to reduce carbon intensity.
So I think you know our approach in energy transition has three focus areas. Things that we can do to lower our
carbon intensity. We have greenhouse gas intensity metrics out to 2023. How we can increase renewables in
support of our business? So we have Algonquin partnership, which we've just announced.

Is this a way to scale up what we've been doing previously? We had some wind and solar to our operations in the
Permian and in the Bakersfield. And this gives us an alliance and partnership to accelerate that and scale it up
globally.
We continue to do, in the renewable space, renewable natural gas, renewable liquid fuels, actions that reduce the
carbon intensity of our products, in particular in California, consistent with the low carbon fuel standard.
And then our third focus area is investing in breakthrough technologies. And that includes carbon sequestration,
hydrogen, battery. We are operating one of the world's largest carbon sequestration projects in Australia.
So it's a long answer to say, we've been in business a long time. We intend to be in business a long time. There
are elections in this country and a number of countries that are occurring. And we intend to be a constructive
force wherever we operate, to be a good partner with whoever is governing at that time. And we think there's a lot
of common ground that we can find between what we do as a company and what governments aspire to do.
So with that, I'll turn it to Jay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Pierre. I'll build on that by just saying, I think there's actually a lot of common ground with where the
potential administrations want to go.
Because we've already been focused on reducing flaring and methane emissions, our greenhouse gas intensity in
producing oil and gas, we've had a head start on this. And we continue to stay focused on reducing the impact
that we have as we produce these essential products.
We think energy plays an essential role in economic growth. And these jobs in the Gulf of Mexico and the
Permian are important jobs to the economy. And I think the emphasis on natural gas as a bridging fuel continues
to support our operations in both the Gulf of Mexico and Permian.
So we'll continue to focus on reducing emissions and lowering our footprint, carbon footprint. But at the same
time, we're going to continue to work with whatever administration is in place and work to make sure that there's a
good understanding of potential regulation and the impacts that it may have as we move forward.

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Good morning, team, and thank you for taking the time here. The first question I have is around cash flow
breakevens. And in the past, Pierre, you've talked about cash flow after CapEx breakeven after $40; at $50 the
dividend; and at $60, the buyback.

Just how do you think about that math there now? There are a lot of moving pieces, particularly with the
Downstream. And there's a lot of flexibility on the CapEx side. But any math you can help us think about your
Brent breakevens would be helpful for aligning the models.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Well, Neil, I mean you're exactly right. When we talk about oil breakevens, we're just talking about one part of the
portfolio and not everything else is held constant. So we've had – we've shown breakevens in the $50s. The
actions that we are taking is to get it down in the $40s. That has an assumption around Downstream
performance. And you won't see that in the second quarter, but you'll see that certainly over time.
I guess I just would first step back and just say, we're in a different place than almost everyone else in our
industry. We have one of the strongest balance sheets, exiting the quarter here with a net debt ratio of 17%.
We've got excellent capital discipline and the ability to flex our capital program down. You saw that. We took it
down 40% in one quarter with an extraordinary change in the circumstances. Reserving the capital, not spending
capital to add barrels that just aren't needed right now as our world is contracting. And then coming out of it and
hopefully recovering in a sustainable way.
We've been ahead of others. We started our asset sales and signed asset sales last year. And you saw those
close this quarter, generating cash. And again we started our restructuring well before COVID, and we're on – and
we have that work on track. And of course we signed an agreement to acquire Noble Energy last week.
So all of our actions are designed consistent with our financial priority. The first is to sustain and grow the
dividend. We showed our stress test last quarter at $30 and I think was made very clear that we have the financial
capability and the flexibility in our capital program and the ability to manage our costs to sustain that dividend
through what is a stress test.
And we're continuing to sustain long term value of the business. So although we're taking activity back in the
Permian, because it brings on production in months and not years, that capital will come back when the world
needs the energy. And the value inherent in that resource is still there. And of course, we're making investments,
as Jay has talked about, in Tengiz, which will come on in several years. And again we're maintaining a strong
balance sheet.
So that's the high level framework. Our goal is to get our breakeven obviously as low as we can. We're planning
for lower for longer. It's a very uncertain environment, to Jason's question. We hope the second quarter was the
bottom. It sure feels like it.
Things are definitely better than they were in the second quarter, in particular in that April, May timeframe. But
we've got to plan for lower for longer. Show our downside resiliency. We know how to manage the upside. That
won't be a problem. But make sure we support the long term value, so that we can not only just pay the dividend
now, but sustain and grow it over time.

Just to build on that a little bit, Pierre. One of the things I really like about the assets as well coming from Noble is
that they also have great capital flexibility. So it fits our strategy quite well. And about 75% of the proved reserves
have already been developed. So the big capital is largely in the past. And now we're looking at the run
opportunities for these assets.

Appreciate it. And the follow-up here is around impairments. You took $4.8 billion in the quarter. Can you just talk
about the framework by which you look at impairments? Obviously, your system is a little different than the IFRS
system of some of your competitors. Do you think you're through the bulk of said impairments? And just talk about
your approach to calibrating them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Sure. Well, let me start with fourth quarter, when we took large impairments. And those were primarily related to
capital decisions, right? Decisions that we made that were primarily natural gas related. And this again of course
is pre-COVID. But in a capital disciplined way and trying to drive higher returns, being really ruthless about where
our capital is invested and making difficult choices. And that was primarily the impact of the impairments that we
saw in the fourth quarter.
This quarter, it was primarily for two reasons. One, unique situation, Venezuela, which I'll comment on, and I'm
sure Jay will add to. And we did lower our price outlook based on the economic impacts from the global
pandemic.
So we don't know what the impact will be. But clearly with the economic contraction and assuming economic
recovery, clearly, but it just results in lower demand for some time period. And we reflected that in the lower
prices.
So in Venezuela, it's been a difficult operating environment for a while. Each quarter we've been assessing our
investment value. In the second quarter, the environment became even more difficult. As an example, our net
production, our share of net production in June was just 7,000 barrels a day. So it'd really fallen off.
And so under the accounting rules and the US GAAP accounting rules, we have to assess whether the loss in
value is other than temporary. And if we view it as other than temporary, we take an impairment. And unlike the
IFRS, it's a one – it only goes one direction. The other ones were tied to the oil price. And I talked about a few of
those. And then we had a severance.
So again we follow US GAAP. We're going to look at it each quarter. What I can say is, the impairment this
quarter, for the most part, had a different nature than last quarter.
And maybe one comment on the price related ones, then I'll kick it to Jay to talk about Venezuela. The price
related ones were really hitting either mature assets, late-in-life assets, where the remaining production term just
gets impacted by the lower price outlook. The long lived assets all are – were not impaired. It was really mature
remaining short life direction – duration, where a lower price impacts the carrying value.
But maybe Jay can comment on Venezuela.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks, Pierre. Venezuela, we took the impairment there. But our fundamental approach has not changed. And
that's that we are still committed to being present in Venezuela. And we look forward to one day resuming full
operations.
Our license was extended to the 1 of December 2020, and that license allows us to take on the activities for
safety and maintaining asset integrity. And our focus is on keeping people and the assets and operations safe.
We support communities in Venezuela. We believe we're a force for good. We'll continue to be compliant with all
laws and regulations, both US and Venezuela. And we just take it a day at a time. But our commitment still
remains. And we think the underlying asset value is still there.

Q

Hi. Thanks. A couple of things. Firstly, on the problems that you had in the quarter. A couple of the other mega oil
companies had very good trading results. Was it fair to characterize you guys as having a smaller trading
operation and appetite, as a result of us not seeing a whole lot of benefit in the quarter? I was just wondering.
And the second, the follow-up, is you mentioned breakeven. I think, Jay – and I'm sure Jay in his comments also
mentioned breakeven. I thought you said breakeven at strip by the end of the year. Pierre, you were talking about
getting down towards $40.
Did I – have I got that wrong in my head? Could you just clarify what's in those various moving parts? It might be
Downstream, or I might have missed that. Apologies. But if you could just bring that together for me. Thanks a lot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. Let me just address the breakeven question. So and – thought that was me. Who – Devin asked that? Well,
anyway, whoever asked it.

So again our breakeven in last year and earlier this quarter was low $50s. And the actions we're taking, again to
reduce capital and reduce costs, which are right on track with our guidance and are going very well, everything
else held constant, that would take our breakeven into the $40s.
But not everything else has held constant, in particular, Downstream and chemicals. We've talked about weaker
margins and much lower volume. So we'll have to see as that shakes out.
But as that, as the Downstream stabilizes over time, then those reductions should flow through to a lower
breakeven.
We talked about Permian being free cash flow positive at strip pricing. So this year in the Permian – and
remember, we had that also as guidance in our Investor Day. It was at a much higher investment level, as we
were on a different trajectory. But even at now this investment level and all the changes that are going on, we
affirm that we'll still be free cash flow positive. But that was only specific to the Permian, and that was at strip
pricing.
If we go to trading, we don't disclose our trading earnings separately. I wouldn't exactly characterize our trading
organization the way you said.
But we've been pretty clear that the priorities for the trading organization are flow, ensuring the flow of our
Upstream barrels and in and out of our refinery to optimize around those positions, and then to trade. And
certainly, at times in the quarter, the market had steep contango, which created trading opportunities for our
organization. And you'll see those results in the Upstream and Downstream segments this quarter and in future
quarters.

Morning, Jeanine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeanine Wai
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q


My first question – good morning. My first question is on the overall business. And I guess understanding that
growth is an output of capital allocation decision, you're working really hard materially to reduce the cost structure.
Is there an opportunity for Chevron to meet the prior ROCE and 3% CAGR targets that you laid out at the Analyst
Meeting at a Brent price below the former $60 that you talked about? Or are those targets just kind of no longer
the right way to think about the business, given your updated view on the macro? I know you just mentioned that
you were planning for lower for longer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, let me start, and Jay might want to add. I mean, yeah, certainly, the ability to deliver that kind of production
volume is there. Because all of the resourcing, the opportunities, whether it's in the Permian, whether it's the other
opportunities we showed during our Investor Day, they are all there.
Now there's no doubt, we had our Investor Day on March 3 and by that weekend – and we showed a $60 Brent
nominal flat pricing for five years, which everyone agreed was a reasonable assumption I think. And by the
weekend, oil was in the $30s when the Russian-Saudi agreement fell apart. And then a few weeks later, we're in
a massive economic contraction.
So there's no doubt that the world has changed from that Investor Day. And we're in the middle of our planning
process. And we'll provide revised updated guidance.
But our ability to deliver that kind of production is absolutely there. The question will be, is that still the right
strategy? I think we have to step back and look at a sector that is underperforming the broader equity markets.
And we're underperforming primarily because of low returns and a lack of capital discipline.
So when you hear us talk about capital discipline in our organic portfolio and the actions that Jay is taking to be
disciplined with our capital and in our Downstream too. Being disciplined around the capital to approach energy
transition, to Devin's question, we have to do that in a disciplined way.
And then organically – inorganically, we have to be disciplined with capital. The only way to increase returns and
regain favor with investors, it's not by outgrowing and it's not by having capital flowing back into opportunity. It's by
being very disciplined and generating high returns by being really ruthless in our allocation.
So I think that's all a way to say is, we're going to – and we're going to revise our plans. All the opportunities are
there. Whether that's the most optimal outlook going forward, we'll decide. But our commitment to capital
discipline, our commitment to raising returns is going to continue. And it's essential for us to be able to deliver
higher returns over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, I think to build on that. We were – we had very strong performance last year and coming into this. But well
before the COVID crisis hit, we had already embarked on a transformation effort.
And that transformation effort was all-encompassing. It covers every aspect of the company. And it's really built
on trying better integrate technology into our operations and our work flows, making sure that we're as efficient as
we can be across our organizations. How do we provide technical services to our business units?

In the Upstream, we reduced from four to three regions. That went into effect July 1. We've reduced one to two
layers across our organization.
We're building on that geographic based business unit in the upstream, which has served us so well. But we're
adding in asset class coordination across business units. So we can better team and perform across business
unit boundaries, geographic boundaries, and segment boundaries.
And we've also added in additional focus on value chains and making sure that we're getting the highest
realization for our Upstream products that we can all the way through the value.
So the transformation itself, while it involves some restructuring, I think some of the biggest impact that's going to
come is around how we think about the business. The financial fluency that we're getting throughout our
workforce, the focus on improving returns and understanding where the gaps are between what's possible and
where we are today. As well as incorporating, as Pierre said, the lower for longer mentality, the lower activity
levels, lower turnaround activity, and some of the other effects that we're seeing.
So as you put all this together, I think we'll continue to see not only the commitments towards lowering our cost
structure, but I do think we're going to find ways to continue to drive for that aspiration of improving returns.

Thanks, Jeanine. Did you have a follow up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeanine Wai
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Yeah, my follow up is kind of a similar question, but on the Permian. In terms of just looking medium and longer
term and on the efficiency improvement that you mentioned, before you mentioned that Chevron can grow the
Permian to about 1.2 million barrels a day, at $4 billion to $5 billion a year CapEx. I know that's a ways off.
But beyond the drilling efficiencies that you mentioned and assuming there's a recovery in demand, how material
could some of these efficiency improvements be that you mentioned? Meaning specifically, based on what you've
seen, do you think you could deliver the same or similar productive capacity of that 1.2 million [barrels] a day but
on materially lower CapEx?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Jeanine, I think we're poised to continue to drive increased efficiency throughout the Permian operations.
The drilling is just one example where we're seeing that efficiency.
But the advances in technology, the advances in our understanding of the reservoirs and how to best complete
and produce from those. The integration of our operation centers, the maintenance, the operations are all driving
efficiency.

While the near term activity levels, we've changed those because we can and because we think it's prudent, given
the current environment that we find ourselves in, the underlying long term value and even mid-term value of this
asset is unchanged. And I'm actually really excited about the changes that we're making in how we are working
together in the organization.
And so I do expect to see us be able to deliver on previous expectations and continue to deliver on becoming a
more efficient, more effective operator in the Permian Basin.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng

Q

Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.

Just I have two questions. I think one for Jay, one for Pierre. Jay, you mentioned about the problem in Gorgon. It's
a bit surprising, given it's a new machine. I mean [ph] the train has (49:57) only come on stream for say less than
five years and that you have this problem. So is the problem is a design issue, or that it's just poor workmanship?
And also whether the same vendor is applying those there to the Train 1 and Train 3 as well as in Wheatstone?
And if they are, have you already did some inspection on those unit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, Paul, so the defects that we found in the wells we believe were there from the original manufacturer.
They're not a design defect at all, but they are a manufacturing defect.
They were discovered in Train 2 when we took Train 2 down for its first major turnaround and inspection. And as I
said, as part of the routine inspection, that's when we encountered this particular issue.
We are evaluating based on the learnings that we've got how to best address Trains 1 and 3. And we put
additional mitigations in place until that's been accomplished.

We do not have the same manufacturer for the vessels in Wheatstone. It's a different manufacturer. And I don't
expect to see the same issue replicated there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng

Q

Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.

And Train 1 and Train 3 already went through the full turnaround recently, right? Just in the last year or two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

No, Train 1 went through the turnaround last year. Train 3 is scheduled for next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng

Q

Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.

So if that's a risk, is Train 3 – there's more of the risk of Train 1 then, because I assume that if that's an issue,
when you went through the turnaround in Train 1, you should have already discover.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

We did not see the issue in Train 1, but we're assessing whether or not we need to re-evaluate that inspection
and go through it again. And we are addressing how best to inspect and, if necessary, repair Train 3 at this time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng

Q

Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.

Okay. So Train 3 will...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Wayne Borduin

General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Paul, did you have a second question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng

Q

Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.

Sure. Second question is for Pierre. I heard about the improving return is one of the top priority for the company.
We appreciate that.
But in here that we have conflicting maybe priority, because from a cash flow standpoint, you are cutting your
CapEx in Permian, and Permian actually is your highest return project, while that you are still investing in Anchor
and Tengiz, which is clearly that much lower return comparing to the Permian.
So how exactly that the company is going to be able to raise your return when you are not investing at least in the
next maybe year or two in the most profitable project? I mean what steps that you would be able to take?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

So, Paul, one of the things we're doing, as you know, we've been bringing our unit development costs in the
deepwater down significantly. Our target is to be below $20 a barrel.

Anchor, as we've talked about in the past, opens up new opportunities for us in a new class of deepwater assets.
We are pacing the development of Anchor in its most efficient pace. We're not focused on having to bring it on by
a certain date, but rather keeping all the different aspects of the project consistent and aligned as we move
through the impacts of the COVID crisis.
In terms of the Permian, it's simply we don't see the point of investing in any assets around the world to bring on
new production capacity when the world is so heavily oversupplied. And so because we have that flexibility, we're
exercising that. And we'll continue to look at the current environment and begin ramping up funding and activities
when it's appropriate to do so and we see a better overall supply/demand balance, better fundamentals for the
industry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng

Q

Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, not only that, what Jay said. Look, we're going to be diversified across different asset classes. We're not a
going to be a pure play company. And they're operating on different time frames.
And one involves production that comes on in years, and one involves production that comes on in months. And
we're making that distinction. So we've been laser focused on capital that supports long term value. Capital that's
adding short term production has been hit very hard.

Q

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I guess two things to follow up on. First question for you, Jay, on TCO. Just what do
you think the critical – you mentioned critical path items. What are those in 2020 and 2021 we really ought to keep
our eyes on for confidence that the project is coming along as expected?
And then I don't know if this second question is for Pierre or for you. But as you think about your outlook for the
Permian unconventional in 2021, the down 6% to 7%, when does that become a written in stone event, versus
something that you could tweak and we could see something different?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

So the critical path for TCO FGP project, it really runs through the setting of all the utility modules and the
compressor boost facilities for the wellhead pressure management part of the project and getting those fully
integrated. And that's where our real focus is.

So it's mechanical, electrical, and instrumentation work, once those modules are set on their foundations. That
really represents the main focus. But there is a lot of work as well that has to be maintained in parallel with that to
be able to deliver the project as expected.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, and look, on the Permian, we could bring completion crews back very quickly, if that were to happen. So
again it's just we're in the middle of our planning process. We'll update our capital budget.
But even after we have a capital budget, we can reallocate capital if the world changes. And there's a lot of
flexibility in the Permian. It goes back to the earlier question. There's a lot of value there. So we'd want to see a
sustained economic recovery, see inventory levels heading down. But it's something that we could change very
quickly with – by adding completion crews and then adding rigs over time.

Well, thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I just had a couple quick ones. Pierre, perhaps you could just elaborate
on your change of price assumption. And what I'm really looking for is, do you anticipate that you will continue to

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, so on the price assumption, I'm not sure I can say much more. We don't disclose our price outlooks. We
view it as commercially sensitive. We're obviously in the market at times selling or buying assets, and we wouldn't
want our counterparty to know what our price outlook is. We don't think that's in the interest of our shareholders.
But again, we lowered our price outlook primarily due to what we think are the likely lower economic activities due
to the global pandemic. No one knows what the recovery will look like. But it's clear that there's been an economic
contraction. And it'll take some time period to recover. And our products are so closely linked to economic activity.
In terms of debt, we had a very successful bond issuance that we did right after last quarter. It was better than
any of our peers in terms of the pricing. And we'll continue to monitor the market.
We're in a very strong position. Our commercial paper balances are well below levels – very comfortable levels.
But we always look at where the market is and where our liquidity is. And we [ph] certainly could go (58:19) to the
bond market and do another issuance if we think it's the right thing to do.

Q

Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a couple of quick ones. The first one's on TCO. And I think, Jay, you
mentioned that you used up some of the contingency on timing. But can you talk about how much contingency
there is left on cost and just get a sense around that? And then I have a follow up on the impairments. Thank you.

Executive Vice President-Upstream Division, Chevron Corp.

The efficiencies that we saw in our schedule and the gains that we made on schedule were consistent with also
gains we were making on cost. But to really tell you where we are, we're going to have to see how we get through
this fourth quarter remobilization and sustaining the workforce. So we'll update cost and schedule probably early
next year.

Okay. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

And, Biraj, we've said about $1 billion less capital this year. A portion of that is deferral. But not half, but a portion
is lower currency effects or currency benefits and higher productivity. So we think some of those cost savings are
rolling through. It's not all just deferral.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Biraj Borkhataria

Q

Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.

Okay. Understood. And then maybe one for you, Pierre. On the impairments, alongside the lower commodity
pricing, did you also adjust your expectations on medium term refining and chems margins?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

There are no impairments on – they're all Upstream related. So, yeah, we have. Again we have various outlooks
for Upstream and Downstream and chemicals margin. But the impairments were all Upstream related.
And they were – there was no LNG, no refining, no chemicals. And again, Venezuela was the biggest part of it.
There was the price related impact. And then there were some suspended costs that also were written off.

Operator: Our last question comes from Jason Gabelman at Cowen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gabelman

Q

Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC

Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about the Downstream business specifically. US Downstream
was particularly weak this quarter. I think even attributing all the timing impacts to the US portion of Downstream,
it still would have missed I think what people were expecting.
Can you just talk about some of the challenges you're experiencing, particularly in that part of the business? I'm
thinking along the lines of maybe your over indexation to the West Coast was a headwind this quarter. And the
outlook for that part of the business in the near term? And I have a follow up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, the first thing I'd say is our execution across Upstream and Downstream was excellent. I mean we ran
safely and reliably across our Upstream and Downstream portfolio under very difficult conditions. And again
extraordinary kind of market conditions.
Jason, I referred to our US crude utilization in the second quarter was 55%. Now it's operating higher than that
now. It's north of 70%, and it's heading towards 80% here in the next couple weeks.
So there were extraordinary contractions. We ran, we matched our supply to our demand. We have sales
channels through our retailers and marketers. And we weren't going to – we were going to meet their demand, but
we tried to minimize any build in inventories and try to match, which is very unusual.
Obviously, we had to significantly reduce our jet production, because the jet reductions were even more
significant. So the actual execution, we thought, was outstanding. It's just I don't think the model frankly worked
under the circumstances that we had in the second quarter.
We never planned – I led that business for three years. Nowhere did I – did we ever plan to run at 55% of crude
utilization. Nowhere did we plan to make as little jet as we possibly could. So it's really extraordinary conditions. It
was all very well executed.
But I think when you take the timing effects, margins, which are not entirely transparent across the portfolio, and
big volume effects, I think you'll get there.

The West Coast, I mean it just varied. There were times the West Coast was better. There was times the West
Coast was worse. I mean it's – I wouldn't view it. If you look at inventory levels on the West Coast in pad 5, they're
actually below year ago level.
So there was nothing I think structural. It was a fast moving set of circumstances in the second quarter. Different
regions were operating at different time periods. Asia, outside the US, obviously held up better in second quarter.
It was more impacted in the first quarter. And that's the kind of nature of operating right now through a global
pandemic and the economic impacts of it.

Q

Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC

Sure. Thanks. And then the follow up. The next kind of large project I guess in your queue is, once TCO ends, are
the two pet chem crackers that have been proposed within the CP Chem JV. I think those were deferred from
being FID-ed either late this year or early next year, but the FID was pushed out.
Can you just talk about how you're thinking about FID-ing those two crackers? And your overall thoughts about
chemicals demand growth, given the pandemic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, I mean chemicals demand has held up better than our refined products. And demand is flat to maybe even
up a little bit. So there's been some mixed effects. Some things are up. Some things are down. But overall pet
chem demand has held up pretty well.
But as you know, even pre-COVID, margins were weak. There's been a lot of supply added. So I'll just keep going
to capital discipline. And that's really the key for the company and for the industry. It's not just the demand side.
We got look at the supply side.
So we have very competitive projects. They are on the low end of the cost curve. In other words, they can
compete better than almost – than most others. Right? They have very advanced feedstocks. We believe they'll
have very low construction costs.
But you're right. We are pacing and deferring those decisions until we get more clarity. We like the business long
term. We'd like to invest in it long term. But we just have to see where the economy goes and really where
industry players go in terms of how disciplined everyone will be about capital investments going forward.
