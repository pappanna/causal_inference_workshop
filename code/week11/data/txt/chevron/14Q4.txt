Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan [ph] and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome toChevron's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at thattime. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ChevronCorporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Jonathan [ph] . Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the callwith me today are Pat Harrington, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Gustavson, the General Manager ofInvestor Relations.We will refer to the slides that are available on our website. Before we get started, please be reminded that thispresentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review thecautionary statement on slide two.Turning to slide three, I'd like to highlight some of our key accomplishments for the year. Starting with safety andenvironmental performance, we had our best year ever on virtually every measure of personal safety, processsafety, and environmental performance. We expect to lead the industry again.Although commodity prices fell sharply late in the year, our overall financial performance was strong. Upstreamand downstream had solid years overall and both ended the year with very good reliability.We had excellent progress on our asset divestment program with significant well-timed upstream sales in Chadand in Canada and high valuation midstream transactions. In the first year of the program, we finalized just under$6 billion in investments versus the $10 billion three-year target for the period 2014 to 2016. We'll update thistarget at our March meeting.Looking at our downstream business, we completed important reliability investments at several of our keyrefineries, which contributed to high utilization rates in the second half of the year. We b ecame the world's largestpremium base oil producer with the startup of a 25,000 barrel per day plant at our Pascagoula, Mississippirefinery. We continued to make progress on our U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project through Chevron PhillipsChemical Company, our 50% owned affiliate. It is now 50% complete.Moving to the upstream business, we started up Jack/St. Malo, which is ramping up ahead of plan and TubularBells in the Gulf of Mexico. In Bangladesh, we successfully expanded production at the Bibiy ana Field. On ourLNG projects in Australia, Gorgon is now 90% complete. We're targeting first gas into the system around themiddle of the year and the first LNG sales this year. Wheatstone made excellent progress and is 55% complete andon track for late 2016 startup. We posted a number of photos highlighting our construction progress on these twoimportant projects on our investor web page.We progressed development of our shale and tight resource holdings, notably in the Permian. We had one of ourbest years from an exploration and resource capture standpoint, with 35 discoveries at a 66% success rate. Weadded 1.4 billion oil equivalent barrels with significant conventional and unconventional adds. We had twopotential hub class discoveries in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and we announced a transaction yesterday toconsolidate holdings around one of them. Our one-year reserve replacement ratio was 89%, taking our five -yearreplacement ratio to 96%.With that, I'll turn it over to Pat who'll take you through our financial results. Pat?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice PresidentAll right. Thanks, John.Slide four provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter earnings were $3.5billion or $1.85 per diluted share. For the year, earnings were $19.2 billion. This equates to $10.14 per dilutedshare. Return on capital employed was 11%, and our debt ratio at year end was 15%. 2014 marked the 27thconsecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment. Given the change in market conditions, we aresuspending our share repurchase program for 2015.Turning to slide five, cash generated from operations was $6.5 billion for the fourth quarter. For the full year, cashfrom operations totaled $31.5 billion. Cash capital expenditures were $9.7 billion for the quarter and $35.4 billionfor the full year. At year end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled more than $13 billion, giving us a net debtposition of about $15 billion.Slide six compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2014 earnings wereapproximately $1.5 billion lower than fourth quarter 2013 results. Upstream earnings decreased $2.2 billionbetween quarters. Lower crude realizations and asset impairments , driven by the sharp decline in crude oil pricesduring the second half of the year and higher DD&A charges, were partially offset by higher gains on asset salesand lower exploration expenses. Downstream results increased by $1.1 billion, driven by stronger internationalrefining and marketing margins, higher gains on asset sales, and favorable timing affects. The decrease in theOther segment primarily reflected higher corporate charges and tax items.Turning to slide seven, I'll now compare results for the fourth quarter of 2014 with the third quarter of 2014.Fourth quarter earnings were $2.1 billion lower than third quarter results. Upstream earnings decreased byapproximately $2 billion, reflecting lower realizations and asset impairments, partially offset by higher gains onasset sales and more favorable foreign exchange effects. Downstream earnings increased by $130 million, drivenby favorable timing effects and gains on asset sales, partially offset by higher operating expenses and a one -timeeconomic buyout of a legacy pension obligation. The decrease in the Other segment largely reflected highercorporate charges.Moving to slide eight, our U.S. Upstream earnings for both the fourth quarter were about $500 million lower thanthird quarter results. Lower liquids realizations decreased earnings by $600 million, consistent with theapproximate 25% decline in the U.S. liquids price indicators between periods. The decline in price has alsotriggered impairments of several smaller assets, which negatively affected earnings by $90 million. Higher gainson asset sales improved earnings by $160 million. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items includingunfavorable tax effects, which were more than offset by the absence of the economic buyout of a long-termcontractual transportation obligation in the third quarter.Turning to slide nine, International Upstream earnings were about $1.5 billion lower than last quarter's results.Lower crude oil prices negatively impacted earnings by $1.4 billion. Our average international crude oilrealizations were down $25 per barrel between the quarters, consistent with the decline in Brent prices. Thesignificant drop in prices triggered impairments for several late -in-life assets, decreasing earnings by $570 millionbetween periods. Higher operating costs reduced earnings by $110 million. Gains on asset sales increasedearnings by $670 million, mainly driven by the farm-down of a 30% interest in our Duvernay Shale interest inCanada, as well as the sale of our Upstream business in the Netherlands.Slide 10 summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent productions between the fourth quarterand third quarter of 2014. Net production increased by 14,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capitalprojects startup and growth from shale and tight resource developments contributed 13,000 barrels per day.Project startups included the expansion of the Bibiyana field in Bangladesh as well as the startup of Tubular Bellsand Jack/St. Malo in the U.S. deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Jack/St. Malo achieved first production in December, ontime and on budget.Entitlement effects increased production by 13,000 barrels per day between quarters. Lower crude pricesincreased volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts, partially offset by lower cost recoveryvolume. Higher planned turnaround activity at TCO's Tengiz SGI SGP facility in Kazakhstan early in the quarterand turnaround activity in Thailand and in Australia decreased production by 19,000 barrels per day.Asset sales in the Netherlands, South Texas and Norway negatively affected production by 11,000 barrels a daybetween quarters. The increase of 18,000 barrels per day in the Base Business and Other bar reflects primarilyhigher reliability from Tengiz following the previously mentioned turnarounds completed earlier in the quarter.Slide 11 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between 2014 and 2013. Netproduction declined by 26,000 barrels per day during 2014 compared to the prior year. Shale and tightproduction increased by 41,000 barrels per day, driven primarily by growth in the Midland and Delaware basinsin the Permian as well as the Vaca Muerta in Argentina. Ramp-up associated with Papa Terra in Brazil and theexpansion of the Bibiyana field in Bangladesh increased production by 13,000 barrels per day. Productionentitlement effects decreased production by 14,000 barrels per day. Price effects were positive due to the decreasein crude oil prices of almost $10 per barrel between years. These were more than offset, however, by negativeentitlement effects in Kazakhstan and lower cost recovery volumes in Bangladesh and Indonesia.Asset sales decreased production by 12,000 barrels a day, due primarily to the sale of our Chad asset earlier in theyear. The Base Business and Other bar principally reflects normal field declines, partially offset by base businessinvestments in Nigeria, in the San Joaquin Valley and in the Gulf of Mexico. Our bas e business continues toperform well with a managed decline rate of less than 3% per year.Turning to slide 12. U.S. downstream results increased $80 million between quarters. Realized margins decreasedearnings by $190 million. Refining margins were weaker on both the West and the Gulf Coast, as the decrease inproduct prices outpaced the decline in crude oil prices. This reflected abundant supply, high inventories and lowerseasonal demand. Timing effects represented $195 million improvement in earnings between the quarters, largelydriven by year-end inventory effects and marking to market on derivatives tied to underlying physical positions.Higher gains on midstream asset sales improved earnings by $210 million. The Other bar consists of severalunrelated items, mainly unfavorable tax effects and higher operating expenses primarily associated with plannedshutdown activity.Turning to slide 13, International Downstream earnings increased by $51 million between quarters. Highermargins, particularly in Asia, increased earnings by $280 million. Refining margins benefited from falling crudeprices while marketing margins were supported by favorable price lag effects for naphtha and jet fuel. Inventoryeffects represented a $100 million improvement in earnings between quarters, mostly reflecting favorable yearendLIFO impacts. A one-time charge related to the buyout of a legacy pension liability decreased earnings by$160 million. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including higher operating expenses andunfavorable foreign currency effects.With that, I'll turn it back to John for a few comments on 2015.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive OfficerOkay. Thanks, Pat.Turning to slide 14. Earlier today, we announced a $35 billion capital program for 2015. This is $5 billion, or 13%lower, than last year. Excluding expenditures by affiliates, the cash component of this program is $31 billion. Thisprogram is lower than we signaled last March and is responsive to current market conditions. It funds key projectswhere we have taken final investment decision and are already under construction. In the upstream, this amountis approximately $14 billion, represented in the dark blue bar on this chart. It includes monies for Gorgon,Wheatstone, Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot and others. This category of spend will decline in the future as projects arecompleted.Base business and shale spending in medium blue on the chart is about $12 billion. A portion of this base businessspend includes critical maintenance and reliability work which has limited flexibility. The majority of the basespend, including shale and tight, is being screened at current prices. We have increasing flexibility in thiscomponent of spend as the year progresses. Spending on pre-FID projects and exploration work is being highgraded,paced, and significantly reduced in response to market conditions. Downstream spending of $3 billion islimited to key projects under construction such as the Gulf Coast chemical project, which, b y the way, is 35%complete, I think I said 50% earlier, 35% complete. And it's also – the spending in the downstream is also limitedto critical reliability and maintenance work.Turning to slide 15. We've reduced our capital budget for the year, conserving cash and preserving value. We alsoare reducing the costs of goods and services and operating expenses. We enter this period of lower prices with avery competitive cost structure. We routinely show you a chart that tracks total cost per barrel in our upstreambusiness relative to our competitors. You've seen we're an industry leader and we have significant cost reductionefforts underway. This chart shows the IHS upstream cost index. Industry costs have more than doubled in thelast decade. Market conditions will create surplus capacity in most key supply chain categories and drive rateslower. We are actively engaged with all suppliers and have enjoyed early success. We expect the opportunity willgrow with time, and particularly so, if prices remain low. We're also taking action to reduce internal costs.You may have seen press coverage of staffing adjustments in the U.K. and Pennsylvania. We have other reviewsunderway in multiple other operating and corporate units. Managing costs aggressively is not new to us. MikeWirth was quite successful in making significant reductions in the downstream in recent years, and if you go backand look at our financial statements in 2008 and 2009, you'll see that we took operating and administrative costsdown $4 billion, or about 15% between years, in response to that brief price excursion. We know how to managecosts.Our production guidance is a range of flat to 3% growth. The uncertainty is a reflection of market conditions. I'llhighlight several of those uncertainties. First, we've had great success in the base business area, limiting decline inmature fields to 3% or less in many years. Our shale programs in the Permian and elsewhere continue. But I'veindicated we're screening this spend at current prices. I've also indicated we're active in our efforts with vendorsand suppliers to reduce costs. The uncertainty in prices and the cost of goods and services creates someuncertainty in the amount of base business investment and the decline rate and growth from ou r shale resources.Second, we've had success in our asset sale program. The full year effect of last year's sales reduces production22,000 barrels a day from 2014. There is uncertainty in the timing and precise composition of this year's asset saleprogram, creating uncertainty in the additional volume impact. Remember, we're driven on all sales by value, andthis can influence timing.Finally, the contributions from major capital project ramp ups and startups this year is significant but relativelysmall movement in the timing of deepwater development wells at Jack/St. Malo, Tubular Bells, or Papa Terra canmake a significant difference in annual production. Similarly, small movements in restart dates for Angola LNG orstartup of Gorgon and other new projects can cause variation.Finally, production sharing contract and other entitlement effects are sensitive to prices and spend levels. Our 3.1million barrel-a-day target for 2017 remains on track as the major projects under construction drive that outcome.That concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in this morning. We're now ready to take somequestions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and onefollow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. So, Jonathan please open up thelines, and we'll take some questions.QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTIONOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Yourquestion, please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jason D. GammelJefferies International Ltd. QThanks very much. John, I just want to ask about taking FID in the current price environment. You spoke abouthow you were seeing – beginning to see cost savings from your providers. And is that something where you wouldprobably just try to delay making an FID to see how that type of negotiation goes with suppliers, or do you expectthat you'll actually have some fairly significant FIDs this year? And I'm really thinking Tengiz expansion as muchas anything else here.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AYeah, and that's – and I think that's the key one to focus on. If you look, we have many projects that are in conceptdevelopment and front-end engineering and design. And so, the overall economics of some of them are impactedby the current price environment. But the project at Tengiz is a good project and that project will ultimately goforward, and we've made significant progress and have good alignment with our partners on that. But we're takingthe opportunity in the current price environment to take a look at contracts, take a look at spend, and see if we canbring costs down further. Now, we have in the plan an expectation that we'll take final investment decisions laterin the year in 2015. Other than that, I can't think of too many significant projects where we're likely to take FIDthis year.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jason D. GammelJefferies International Ltd. QAnd then just as a follow up, John, do you have any deflation built into the capital budget for 2015, or is it allreduced activity levels?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AWell, it's a little bit of both, Jason. We do have – I mean for example, we've dropped over 20 rigs. So – which isabout 15% of our worldwide rig count. So as I said, we're screening projects based on the current level of prices ifthe return is near at hand. So if you have short cycle -based business or shale investments and they don't meetinvestment hurdles at current prices, which is the revenue you're likely to realize, we're pulling them from theprogram and we've cut rigs all over the world.Now many things continue to pass the hurdle, and so we are continuing with our development. For example, ourwork in the Permian passes the hurdle, and so we're continuing that and have had good success. But we're alsotaking on costs in a fairly big way if you look around the world. Rigs get a lot of attention, but that's actually notthe biggest category of spend. EPC costs, well construction services, transportation, the fab yards are going toempty out here, and rigs, we're taking on all of these things, and we have a centralized procurement organizationas well of a lot of people in our business unit that are taking advantage o f the opportunity and spare capacity in thesupply chain. It varies considerably depending upon the category of spend that we're talking about and the precisetimingIf you look – I mean, on rigs, we had one offer in one location around the world of a 50% reduction in rig rate.We've already captured retroactive January 1 rig reductions in some areas. So we're taking this on in a big way andwe have targets. We've baked in a little bit into our numbers, but this is a very fast -moving market and the longerthis downturn persists, the more we're likely to capture and the more it will be reflected in the major categories ofspend like EPC costs and major fab yard spending that we might make on projects. Okay, let's go to the next one.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jason D. GammelJefferies International Ltd. QThanks, John. I appreciate your comments.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer ASure. Ed Westlake?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Edward George WestlakeCredit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QThanks, John. So I mean, this is a high-level picture, and yes/no answer probably, has anything changed to yourview that oil demand is growing, and has anything changed about the decline rates that you feel the industry ha sto overcome?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AYeah, overall, the general picture that I've laid out to you before and we've talked about, is that as long as theworld economy grows, there's a reasonable correlation between world economic growth and growth in energydemand. If the world economy grows 3% to 4%, we tend to see 1% to 2% growth in energy consumption. In ourview, maybe 1% for oil, 2% for gas over that time period. So that general picture hasn't changed. Now it can beinfluenced in the short run by macro events and prices and things of that sort. One of the things that we're tryingto get a handle on and that others are looking at is, how responsive will global demand be to the price reduction?If you look at some of those that follow us very closely, they can see increases of 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a dayfrom lower prices. But you've also got countries around the world that are reducing demand -side subsidies andthings of that sort. So it's a function of economics and it depends how long this persists. Truck sales in the U.S. aredoing pretty well right now. So I think we'll get a bump from lower prices, and I think we'll see growth of perhapsa million barrels a day in demand worldwide in 2015, but that number could mo ve around a little bit.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Edward George WestlakeCredit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QAnd then specifically Gorgon, you've kind of reiterated the timetable. Can you give us any nuggets to give youconfidence that we will get that first gas in Gorgon, mid-year and the first LNG cargo this year?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AWell, I'll tell you, there's nothing that's a higher priority for us right now than that, Ed. And as I said, we're 90%complete. We've got 8,000 people on the site right now. That's a little more than we might've told you in the past.We've brought in a big accommodation vessel, and so we put more people on site. We've made terrific progress onthe upstream side, basically all 18 wells have been drilled, all upstream sub-sea infrastructure is in place, pipelineinstallation is complete. You can see a lot of this on the website. So those things are good. So we're working allthose things very hard. We've got really mechanical, electrical instrumentation work that's in high gear right now.And we're basically milestone-driven in commissioning and starting up systems right now. And that's really ourfocus.We're monitoring very closely contractor performance and productivity on the island. We're working wi th theunions on contracts and industrial relations. We've been able to manage through those things fairly well, andwe're planning for a flawless startup – commissioning and startup process. We've got risks of adverse weather thatare there, but we're shooting to get gas into the system in the middle of the year timeframe and get some cargoesout this year. That's our focus. George and Jay Johnson are heading down there here in February, so when wecome back in March at the analyst meeting, we'll have some very fresh information for you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Edward George WestlakeCredit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QThanks so much.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer ASure.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [ph] Alex Dayersim (25:51) from Citi. Yourquestion please?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................QThank you. Thank you, John. Can I just come back to the charts on CapEx? I was just trying to get a feel for howthe different buckets of CapEx are moving year-on-year so the base business and the projects under construction?Where the big revisions are?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AYes, sure. Spending's come down $5 billion overall. Some of that is in LNG spend of – it was a little over $10billion in 2014 in total. It's a little over $8 billion planned in 2015. So that's a little bit of the spend. Deepwaterspend is relatively flat. Shale and tight spend is a little bit higher, but some of our other base business spend isdown. We've got about a 10% to 15% reduction in exploration expense between years, and of course we also havethose mid-cycle projects, those that are in concept design or engineering that – there are fewer of those, there'sless spend in those categories this year than in the past.So we're working very hard on all of those costs, and of course you may be asking about how do those categorieslook going forward? And we do expect growing flexibility in our spend as we move forward. One of the things we'llshow you in March when we get there is that that bottom bar, those projects under construction and the $14billion, that number comes down in time. The LNG spend this year and next will continue to be significant, but aswe get to 2017, it's under $1 billion. So I expect you'll see some reduction in that category.Now we may take FID on some projects, so you may have some additional spend in that category, but in principle,there's a very high roll off rate from that category of projects under construction. The base business spend is afunction of both economics and how much we can wring out of the system from a cost point of view. So there'sactivity and there is the cost of that activity, and I commented on some of the sort of trends that we're seeing inthat category.I will say exploration, we're going to continue to explore. We had fabulous success, particularly toward the end of2014, in the Gulf of Mexico with a couple of discoveries and the transaction we had with a couple of other playersin the business. So we'll continue to high-grade that activity, but we have growing flexibility in all categories is, Iguess, the comment I'd like to leave you with.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................QCould you give us some sort of a sense about as you dial down that base business spend in 2015, what impact thatmight have on underlying decline rates in the business?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AYeah, I think that is – I think that's a risk for the industry. I think that that was the comment earlier. I think that isa growing risk for the industry. If you go back to 2008 and 2009 period, and this is a hard number to get at, butwe saw an increase worldwide in decline rates for all companies, basically for the entire industry, increase by apercent or two. And that's very significant. We've done a good job of keeping decline rates to 3% or less, and Ithink we've got a good chance to do that. But obviously, when you cut some rigs, you have some risk of a higherdecline rate in 2015 relative to past years.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................QThank you. That's very helpful. Thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question,please?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC QHey. Good afternoon, everybody. My question is just a follow-up on CapEx, and I appreciate that it's a fluidprocess. On your current guidance today, where do you expect the production impact? It doesn't appear to impactthe guide for 2015, at least in the high end. Is it altering that 2017 guide? Or is it really a much more long -datedimpact given the longer cycle time of a lot of your resource?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AYeah, Evan, you just hit it. The impact is predominantly over the longer term, because we're continuing with theprojects under construction and we're deferring some projects and spend that could have some impact, well, thatwill have some impact on production, but it's generally outside the window that we're talking about.For example, the Tengiz project will be a good project, but it's not going to produce volumes inside the 2017window. Similarly, when you cut, make reductions in exploration spend, you're not going to impact productioninside the window. So I would think of most of it as being a long-dated impact.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC QAnd is the 3%, the 2015 production guidance, that's on current prices, I presume, assuming no asset sales is how Iguess I read the sensitivity? Obviously, there are PSE effect there and asset sales. Is that correct, that that's basedon current prices? Current strip?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AYeah, it is. I think it really governs the full range. It's a pretty good range, frankly. Normally, we've given pointestimates, but there are a lot of moving categories this time, so it really encompasses the range of outcomes thatare possible based on where we are today. For example, as you point out, at lower prices you do get a benefit insome of our PSE agreements from those lower prices. Where you spend money it takes more barrels to repaycosts, for example, on cost barrels. But the flip side is that you may spend less, and so there will be less to recover.For example, we are reducing spend and have cut some rigs in Indonesia in response to economics. So you dohave some offsets in these categories, and of course depending upon when you make asset sales, that has a directimpact on volumes.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC QAnd just a follow up, if I could. You mentioned that you continue to monitor and be responsive to marketconditions, so I presume that further cuts would be responsive to a deterioration in market conditions? And then Iguess you gave – I like the classification on slide 14. I guess what – how much of the $12 billion base is being spentin 2015 on shorter cycle that may be more controllable if conditions warranted?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AWell, virtually everything in that category is shorter cycle activity. There are some critical maintenance andreliability investments that we'll continue to make. Same thing in the downstream. We've got – you need to keepyour facilities running and in good shape. So there is a category that I would say is inflexible that is in the basebusiness. Although the cost of delivering those goods and services may go down during the period, the activityitself will continue.From an activity point of view, as time goes by and rig contracts roll off, we have growing flexibility in thiscategory. I mean, ultimately, you have a great deal of flexibility in this category of spend. But as I say, and we'll beresponsive to market conditions and screen activity out if it doesn't meet our thresholds.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC QGreat. Thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer ASure.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question,please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ryan ToddDeutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QGreat. Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe if I could follow up with a question on pricing in the currentenvironment. Between the changes in the LNG market that we've seen in terms of where LNG is coming from, inparticular potentially a ramp in U.S. supply and then the reduction, the collapse that we've seen in oil price, areyou seeing anything in potential LNG market pricing either for existing projects or for future projects? Any changein the trends?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AAny change in trend? Well, the trend has been a very fluid environment and a ve ry – frankly there's been a lot ofpressure on LNG pricing, both in response to immediate conditions and response to the projects that have gone toFID around the world, so there is pressure on LNG markets.Notwithstanding that, we did sign a contract dur ing this period that's an oil-linked contract with a reputablecompany for a medium-term slice of volume toward the end of the decade, which gets us up into the range wherewe feel pretty good about the projects Gorgon and Wheatstone where we'll – or we'll basically be at our target forsales, will be between 75% and 80% on Gorgon and 85% for Wheatstone, so we feel in pretty good shape.Now, we obviously need good contracts that underpin new developments. So one of the projects that we're pacinguntil we can see conditions that'll support a project is at Kitimat in Canada. We're continuing with some of thework we have underway to delineate the resource and reach agreements with First Nations people and permittingand things of that sort. But we're signific antly pacing the spend of that project, and we'll get alignment on it andhave good alignment in early days with Woodside, which has replaced Apache. Other than that, I think there's – Ithink people are pretty cautious right now in the LNG market. Our view is, it's not clear that all the brownfieldprojects that – excuse me, greenfield projects that are being contemplated, can meet economic hurdles at some ofthe prices we're seeing.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ryan ToddDeutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QRight. Maybe that...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AAnd demand is out there.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ryan ToddDeutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QRight. And maybe that's a – speaking of Kitimat, that's a good transition to a second question, which is just from ahigh-level strategic view, when you look out from here over the next 10 years, has your view of the future changedat all in the sense that are there, when you look back I guess over the past 10, are there projects, business models,efforts that have been part of your business model in the last five to 10 years that, when you look forward over thenext 10, you think just may not work anymore, whether it's large -scale gas projects or oil sands or any type of – Iguess, your views at a high level on changes in the industry over the next 10 versus the last 10?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AYeah, well, my basic view is that, in fact there was a reference in a question that was asked earlier is, energydemand continues to grow. And if you look at the decline curve that's inherent in our business, and let's talk aboutthe oil side for a moment, oil fields decline worldwide roughly 15% a year without investment. The industry worksvery hard with base business investments to attenuate that decline every y ear. But still, you do get declines of 3%to 5% industry -wide, so you need new oilfields to meet demand.The 3% to 5% decline on a 90-plus million barrel-a-day base is significant, and so you need investments in newfields. And $50 does not support large new field development, and what I would call the big volumes that aregoing to contribute to meeting demand, whether it's oil sands, deepwater, aren't supported at $50. So that's whyyou're seeing forward prices, and most in the industry expecting to see some rebound in prices, because we simplywon't be able to support those projects at those kinds of prices.Now there – in the short run, when you have a supply that's exceeding demand in our business, short-run supplyand demand are not very responsive to prices, so it takes that decline kicking in or action by OPEC or a strongereconomic growth to close that gap. And that's what will be required here over the next period of time to get pricesinto a range where they can support the sorts of projects that you're referencing.Our view is, those forces are at work right now, and we can debate when that gap will close, but the forces are atwork and with every announcement of C&E cuts, it's more likely to happen sooner. So my basic view is the worldneeds energy, and the prices have to support the activity. And of course, we monitor the cost environment thatwe're in. We can see short run reductions in costs that can make projects more economic, but in general theprojects that are going to meet demand going forward are more complex than 20 or 30 years ago. And so the costsof those projects will be higher and require a higher price than we're seeing today to meet the volume targets.Probably a long explanation, but that's how we think of it.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ryan ToddDeutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QThanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer ASure.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question,please?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. QHey. Good morning, John and Pat. John, oftentimes, with risks often come opportunity, and especially thatproceed a little bit longer potentially that you could have distressed assets out there in the U.S., maybe alsooverseas. So from a high level, how you guys look at under that circumstances, I mean, how much are you willingto use your balance sheet or perhaps that risk in your balance sheet a little bit and then also to use perhaps yourcurrency is not necessary at the best point that you want, but will you be willing to also use it in a decent -sizetransaction?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AWell, we – all the time, Paul, you and I have talked many time, over the years, we're a depleting resource business,so we have to acquire leases, discover resource and frankly companies, overtime, and we're very targeted in howwe do that, and we try to be commercially smart and take advantage of the opportunities when there's lesscompetition for those assets. So we are actively screening the opportunities that are out there, and we'll takeadvantage of opportunities that we see.One that's on the smaller end of the scale, but just a couple of days ago, we did announce a consolidatingtransaction in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with a couple of partners, and we think we've acquired resource at acompetitive cost relative to exploration costs, and so – and there are benefits to all parties from working todevelop a common set of assets together in one hub.But that's – so we do take a look at the opportunities that are before us. Now I have to tell you, our priority rightnow isn't acquisitions. Our priority at the moment is completing the projects that are under construction, and wedo have balance sheet parameters that we work within to do that. But you point out, on a relative basis, we've got apretty good currency, and we're mindful of the opportunity set that's there.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. QAnd if I could just put in a quick question? In your supply cost, any rough idea of what is the percent of yoursupply contract, whether it's rate, EPC, those have a duration longer than two years? So in other words, what isthe percentage of your cost base both in capital and operating costs that potentially we could see the benefit fromthe deflationary environment that we're expecting over the next 12 to 18 months?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AWe have a number of contracts that roll off during that period. I would say by the time you get to 2017, almost allspend becomes variable, if you will, so in fact, a lot of it this year rolls off. Now we do have deepwater rig contractsthat have been staggered and go out a few years. We do have fabrication contracts that have already been let thatgo out several years – that can go out several years, but the majority, the vast majority of the spend going forward,if you out to say 2017, the vast majority of that spend will be reflective of current market conditions.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. QThank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of come from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.Your question, please?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QHi, everyone. And, John, thanks for being on the call. John, from this level, are you saying that you expect CapExto go lower, and do we now say that the 3.1 million barrels a day 2017 target for volumes is gone? And one queryI'd have about that is it was previously lowered because of an assumption that oil prices would be higher. If yourecall your previous planning assumption had been, I think 79, and it was a move up to a higher price that causedyou to lower the target. Wouldn't there be a reverse effect down here? Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AYes. Well, I did reaffirm the 3.1 in my comments earlier, so I have reaffirmed that target. And I will say there arequite a few moving parts in getting to the 3.1. First, most o f the growth between now and then is underpinned byGorgon, Wheatstone, Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot, Mafumeira Sul and others that are under construction. And I'veindicated we're continuing to fund that spending.We have had, over the years, some changes in the composition of the remainder of the volumes that contribute tothe 3.1. For example, we previously flagged in response to U.S. gas prices we had reduced spend in that area. Onthe other side, the Permian wasn't in our plans when you go way back to 2010 and volumes coming from that areaare higher.There has been a big change in prices and price effects, as I indicated earlier, can impact volumes. Other thingsbeing equal, there is a contribution, if we get to 2017 and prices are much lower, there will be a positivecontribution that's inherent in that 3.1. The other side, as I also commented, is that we have fewer – we have lessimpact from that if our spend goes down in places like Indonesia. And finally, we have asset sales that couldinfluence that target. But as we see it today, with all those effects, some that are positive, some that are negative,we still see that 3.1 target. C&E...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QJohn, I guess what I'm driving at, is that based on the $35 billion, or do you think you could come lower on the$35 billion of spending and still make the 3.1? And would you manage towards the 3.1? Is that what you're saying?Because I guess you do have a view...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer ANo! No. No, that's specifically not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that we have always – the volume hasalways been an outcome, Paul.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QYes.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AIt's always been an outcome. We make decisions based on economics. What I'm telling you is that I see theoutcome being 3.1 because 80% to 90% of the volume increase between now and then are the projects that areunder construction. And we make investment decisions on our be st view of go-forward economics and in responseto the best value propositions that we can see. The precise level of spend going forward, the only thing I'll flag – asyou know, I've been reticent to talk about C&E going forward, and this last year's a per fect illustration as to why.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QRight.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AWe have a lot of moving parts, many of which I've described. We also have currency movements and uncertainties.We have growing flexibility in our spend going forward. And if the kind of price environment we see todaypersists, you will see lower spending, absolutely.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QGot it. I mean, I guess what I was driving at is that you had previously guided towards the flat CapEx from theprevious $40 billion level in order to meet the 3.1. I think what you're now saying is you can still meet the 3.1 andwe could even then still see lower CapEx again in meeting the 3.1. Or do I think about i t that you're potentially notgoing to meet the 3.1 and bring down CapEx appropriately with the oil price?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AI think the outcome is a function of spend that is largely already committed. As one of the qu estions earliercommented on, is there much volume effect for some of the cuts? Most of the volume effect will be after 2017,because they're these longer-cycle projects where we're taking a pause and trying to work the costs down.So we're in a long – you know very well, Paul, we're in a long cycle business. And so if you defer longer -termprojects now, it will mean lower production than you might otherwise have seen beyond the target date of 2017. Sothere is an impact beyond 2017 of the decisions that we're making today. But because we have all these projects inflight, we don't see a significant impact to our target beyond the factors I talked about before of base businessspend, timing of asset sales, quantity of asset sales, cost barrel effects and things of that sort.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QThat's very helpful, John. And a very quick one. Could you indicate how high you think debt can go in order to –and allow you still to maintain your targeted credit rating? Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AYes, I am going to let my CFO talk about the balance sheet and credit rating.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AYes. And, Paul, we have a lot of borrowing capacity still available to us. We ended the year with a 15% debt ratio,and there's a lot of appetite in the capital markets for our debt, and under the scenarios that we're talking abouthere in this price range with this capital program, we anticipate still being very nicely within the AA band. Andafter you get through 2015 really, and you look ahead, obviously, we're going to see more production growth. Johntalked about the flexibility that we've got.As time rolls on with our capital program, we talked about and we do b elieve that there will be some recovery inoil price. We don't know to what level or exactly how quickly, and there'll be adjustments to our cost structure, sowe feel very comfortable with the position that we're in, and John referenced earlier, managing within certainconstraints and that one of the balance sheet constraints is maintaining a strong AA.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QIs there a rule of thumb for how much debt you can have and still be AA?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AI don't think there's a rule of thumb, because the rating agencies take into account not only what your financialparameters are, but also what your operating parameters are and what your prospects for future cash flowgeneration really are. So it's a combination of what the overall business plan, so to speak, for the enterprise is thatthe rating agencies take into account. But suffice it to say, we have incremental borrowing capacity of several,several – tens of billions of dollars here.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QAll right. Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AIn the tens of billions of dollars.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QOkay. Thanks, all of you. Thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AThank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Phil M. GreshJPMorgan Securities LLC QHi. Good morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AGood morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Phil M. GreshJPMorgan Securities LLC QFirst question is kind of following up, I guess. In terms of trying to achieve dividend coverage and how you thinkabout when you can get there, full 100% dividend coverage, any color you could provide about how you kind ofbridge to that? Because it looks like this year, kind of the shortfall in the free cash flow and then the dividend, youadd that up, it's maybe $15 billion to $20 billion. So anything you could provide around that. It sounds likeoperating costs you've highlighted maybe $4 billion of opportunity, but just generally how you're thinking aboutthat?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer ASure. Our plan is to cover the dividend in 2017, and we won't do it this year in all likelihood. In fact, we flaggedthat. If you go back to two or three years, three or four years, we have said – in fact, it was in response to questionsaround our balance sheet at that time where we had more c ash than debt on the balance sheet, and a lot of youwere encouraging us to repurchase more shares and to really take advantage of the lower cost of debt, and we said,look, our primary case may not be falling oil prices, but we've got a lot of projects under construction and we're ina commodity business and we need to be able to withstand the ups and downs of our business. And so what I saidat that time is that we would be restoring our balance sheet to something that might be a more normal level for aAA credit rating as time goes by and these projects roll off.So when you get – the reason I say 2017 is our production will grow between now and then by about 20%, and soat whatever price level we're at, we'll see benefits to free cash flow from that. I've talked about the flexibility in theactivity level that we have, which can moderate spend and bring us back into balance. And then of course, as youmentioned, the cost reduction efforts that we have underway both in the supply chain and internally will help usattenuate that. Finally, bridging us and helping us on the balance sheet are the contributions from asset sales. Andyou saw we got off to a pretty good start in the program this year. But we've flagged and indicated that even athigher prices that we were going to use our balance sheet, and we're going to use a little more of it this year thanperhaps would've been the case with higher prices, but we're able to attenuate that over a couple of years.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Phil M. GreshJPMorgan Securities LLC QSo just a clarification on that then. I mean, with the strip in the low 60s, is it fair to say that you've got yourproduction growth, layer in the strip, take out $4 billion in costs, you would actually plug the CapEx to get to alevel that covers the dividend?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AWell, I'm not going to give you a specific price forecast. I'll just say that the boundary conditions that I'moperating – that we're operating under, and these are things Pat has talked to you many times, the boundaryconditions, the dividend is the highest priority of spend for us and we want to keep sufficient flexibility on ourbalance sheet to withstand the ups and downs in the commodity markets. So we will work very hard on CapEx andOpEx in order to get balanced in a couple of years.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Phil M. GreshJPMorgan Securities LLC QOkay. And just my follow-up question is just, is there anything in the production guidance for 2015 for Gorgonand for Angola LNG at this point? Or would execution on that, timing-wise be upside to the guidance? Just how tothink about that and the update on the Angola LNG in general?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AWell, there's a scenario where we could beat to the upside of the range that we've indi cated. But frankly I'm a littlegun-shy on that sort of thing given the kind of operating environment that we're in right now given where pricesare and potential adjustments to spend. So, yes, we expect to see volumes from those assets this year. The exac ttiming brings in some variability, but our plan is to have both of those contributing volumes this year.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Phil M. GreshJPMorgan Securities LLC QOkay. Thanks a lot.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Reid from Bank of Montréal. Your question,please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Iain S. ReidBMO Capital Markets Ltd. QHi, John. Just a question about your onshore drilling activity, you seem to be maintaining or increasing yourdrilling in the Permian whereas some of the other companies seem to be deferring it on the basis that they'll beworth more in a couple of years' time by leaving it in the ground. Just kind of interested in your take on thatversus what you're planning?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AWell, we have about 30 rigs running in the Permian, and we continue to screen the economics of those. I thinkwhat I said is our spend on unconventionals will be, and shale will be higher this year than last. But thatencompasses our worldwide activity that we expect to see.So we're still – by the way we've had some terrific performance in the Permian, part of the reason we're able to dothat is we've been able to dramatically reduce costs. When we get ahead to March at our analyst meeting, we'll giveyou a fair amount of information on how we're doing. Some of the horizontal pad drilling programs that we'reputting in place, we're seeing very, very good early results. But we need to see good returns on these things tomake investments, and so I'll just say we do expect some recovery in prices as the year wears on, but if we end upin a depressed environment, we could make adjustments to that.Remember, a lot of our volume in that area, we benefit from no royalty. And that's a big competitive advantage asyou get down to where others might be at the margin more than we are. We're in pretty good shape because wedon't have royalty. We've got a long, long queue available to us.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Iain S. ReidBMO Capital Markets Ltd. QOkay. Just one other thing. I heard what you said on Wheatstone sales on schedule. I just wonder, though, whereyou are in terms of budget and CapEx. Is there any update you can give us on that relative to the original budget?Because we haven't had a mid-project update on that one?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer ANo, we're still operating under the current appropriation request that we approved, which is the Wheatstoneproject was a $29 billion U.S. project, and we've had some ups and downs. Frankly, right now, we're benefitingfrom currency movements, the Australian Dollar is around $0.78. So we're benefiting from that. We've had someups and downs there, but and have used some of the contingency in the project, but we're still operating withinthat same appropriation request.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Iain S. ReidBMO Capital Markets Ltd. QOkay. Appreciate it.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Yourquestion, please?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateBank of America Merrill Lynch QThanks. Good morning, John. Good morning, Pat.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AGood morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateBank of America Merrill Lynch QJohn, you've obviously got a tough job of trying to manage through the cycle. If you look at the near -term growth Ithink you've been pretty clear, that's pretty much prefunded with the commitments you've got going on. But onceyou get to 2017, once you've delivered your target, assuming an oil price range, which is lower than we've had inthe last five years, how do you think about the trade-off between continued growth versus other uses of cash like areturn to buybacks? And what's on my mind is over the last 10 years before the growth phase, the share prices didjust fine in a relatively flat production profile over that 10 year period. So that's my first question and I have arelated follow-up, please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AWell, I guess I would say volume has always been an outcome of our views about the quality of the investmentsthat we have available to us. And that will continue to govern our decisions. If we wind up in a lower priceenvironment in 2017 than we might've thought we would be in a year ago, I think there will be contributing factorsto that. One will be costs. And so we don't make decisions to invest based on a volume target. We make decisionsto invest based on our perception of the value that's available to us.There were a confluence of events that resulted in several significant projects coming together at the same time.We had lease retention issues, we had good gas contracts available to us, for example, on Wheatstone, we had hada moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico, which slid things, and you had lease commitments and things of that sort.So you wouldn't ordinarily choose to have all those projects be together, but we felt individually they were good,and we felt we had the capacity to handle them. And we're starting to see them deliver today, and frankly if youlook at a – for all the talk about these projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone are 30 to 40-year projects. They haven'teven come online yet. And when they come online and over the cycle, I'm very comfortable that the economics willbe just fine, and they'll be prolific contributors to the company for years to come. And all these new projects alsohave follow-on opportunities to them, because we typically – first phases of projects don't result in all the resourcebeing developed and incremental economics are better.Our priority around spend has been pretty clear. One, we're going to pay the dividend, and we're going to increaseit as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit, and we'll invest to do that. And we'll do that within theparameters of our balance sheet. We have viewed share repurchases as a flywheel . And the flywheel is – wasavailable to us.We have consciously spread out share repurchases over time, so we've tried not to just be in for a short period oftime, we were in for a longer period of time. But we're obviously, with the price environment we're seeing, we'rediscontinuing that program. But if we get to a circumstance where we're generating cash flow and we don't see theopportunities, we've got no reticence at all to repurchase shares if we think that's a better opportunity for us.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateBank of America Merrill Lynch QThanks, John. My follow up, I'll be quick, I realize we're at the top of the hour, but it's kind of more of a macroquestion. It's going to be a tough one to answer. But when we think about Chevron's role as a global player, $1.9million a day of oil and the operated is obviously a lot bigger than that. If we think of Chevron being representativeof big oil and non-OPEC needs a certain oil price environment to maintain flat production, what would thatnumber be for Chevron? In other words, to hold production flat close to the startup of the major projects, can youhold flat at 50 or 60 or 7 0? What do you think that number is? And I'll leave it there.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer AWell, that – you're right, it is a tough question. If we're in a $50 world, there will not be, just as I said at a macrolevel, around the world, I don't see many investments that are going to go with the fiscal terms we see in placetoday, with the costs at the cost levels we see today, I see very few major oil projects going forward. There will beincremental investments on existing projects to mitigate the decline. There will be some shale investments thatmay be economic, but I don't know, for example, around the wo rld of deep full-cycle economics, deepwaterprojects that go at $50 bucks at the current cost structure.I don't know of new oil sands volumes that can come on at $50. And there are oil fields in decline everywhere. So Ijust don't see that. Now costs can adjust, fiscal terms can adjust, and so it's hard to speak definitively for a verylong period of time, but it's very clear that the incremental barrels are coming from more complex developmentsover time. With all the enthusiasm around shale, I think it's important to remember, it's four million barrels a dayout of a 92 million barrel base, and you're going to see the rate of growth in that volume was due to slow, andyou're going to see a reduction in that rate of growth in response to current prices.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive OfficerI think we're at the end of our time. I thank you very much for the questions. That – in closing, just say weappreciate everyone's participation. I especially want to thank the analysts, on behalf of all participants. We'll lookforward to seeing you at our March security analyst meeting. So, Jonathan, thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude Chevron's fourth quarter 2014earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Good day.
