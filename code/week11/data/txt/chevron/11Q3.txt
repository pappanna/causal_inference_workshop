Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being
recorded.
I will now turn the call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat
Yarrington. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay. Thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call
with me today are Mike Werth, Executive Vice President of Downstream and Chemical; and Jeanette Ourada,
General Manager, Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the third
quarter of 2011. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on Slide two.
Slide three provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $7.8
billion or $3.92 per diluted share. Earnings in the third quarter of 2011 were more than twice that of third quarter
2010. Upstream benefited from higher crude oil prices, and downstream benefited from gains on asset sales and
improved margins.
Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months exceeded 22%. Our debt ratio at the end of September was
7.5%. This is lower than previous quarters due to the early and economic redemption of a $1.5 billion Chevron
Corporation bond.
In the third quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the fourth quarter, we expect to repurchase the
same amount.
Of particular note, we announced Wednesday that Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.03 per share or
3.8% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend. Our Board took the unusual step to authorize a second
dividend increase this year because of the company's strong performance and financial position as well as their
confidence in the company's future cash generating capabilities. Chevron has a long history of annual dividend
increases, 24 consecutive years. The two dividend actions in 2011 result in an annual quarterly dividend increase
of 12.5%, which is consistent with our priority of delivering long-term dividend growth to our shareholders.
Turning to slide four, cash generation from operations was $11.5 billion during the third quarter. This is, yet
again, a new quarterly record for the company, and has resulted from continued strong operational performance.
Asset sales during the quarter, which included the Pembroke refinery, generated about $2 billion in proceeds.
Year to date, cash generated from operations was $32 billion, reflecting the strong cash generating power of our
recent investments and of our base business. This strong cash flow allows us to both reinvest in the top tier project
queue as well as reward our shareholders with meaningful dividend growth and a sustainable share repurchase
program.

At quarter end, our cash balances totaled over $20 billion, up $3.3 billion year to date. This puts us in a net cash
position of $10.6 billion.
Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.

General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Pat.
Turning to slide five, I'll compare results of the third quarter 2011 with the second quarter 2011. As a reminder,
our earnings release compares third quarter 2011 with the same quarter a year ago.
Third quarter earnings were $7.8 billion, slightly higher than second quarter earnings. Starting on the left side of
the chart, upstream earnings were down $670 million, driven by lower crude oil realizations and lower volumes,
partly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects. Downstream results increased $942 million between quarters,
benefiting from gains on asset sales, favorable foreign exchange effects, and improved international margins. The
variance in the Other bar reflects an unfavorable swing in corporate tax items.
On slide six, our U.S. upstream earnings for the third quarter were $442 million, lower than the second quarter's
results. Combined crude oil and natural gas realizations reduced earnings by $190 million. Chevron's average U.S.
crude oil realizations decreased 7% between consecutive quarters, slightly higher than the 5% drop in posted
Midway-Sunset and LLS spot prices. Natural gas realizations also dropped, decreasing 5% between quarters, in
line with average Henry Hub spot prices.
Between quarters, sales volumes decreased 32,000 barrels oil equivalent per day, decreasing earnings by $105
million. The Other bar is comprised of a number of unrelated items, including the absence of gains on several
small asset sales during the second quarter.
Turning to slide seven, international upstream earnings were down $228 million compared with the second
quarter. Lower realizations decreased earnings by $225 million. Unit realizations for liquids decreased about 4%,
in line with the decrease in average Brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations were relatively flat between periods,
but benefited earnings by about $45 million due to sales mix.
Lower liftings across multiple countries decreased earnings by $250 million. Between consecutive quarters,
liquids liftings were down 54,000 barrels per day and natural gas sales volumes were down 26,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day. Comparing third quarter liquids production with third quarter liquids liftings, we were underlifted by about 1%.
Moving to the next bar, as you know, the UK raised the effective tax rate from 50% to 62% in July, retroactive to
March. The total impact recognized in the third quarter was $180 million, about $135 million related to the first
six months and about $45 million related to the current quarter.
Moving to the next bar, a favorable change in foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $275 million. The U.S.
dollar strengthened against many currencies, most notably the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. The
third quarter had a foreign exchange gain of about $305 million compared to a small gain of about $30 million in
the second quarter. These foreign exchange effects have minimal impacts on cash. They are primarily balance
sheet translation effects. The Other bar reflects a number of items, including lower exploration expense and lower
OpEx.
In total, our global upstream earned almost $27 per barrel for the quarter. Based on preliminary competitor
results announced today, we outpaced our nearest competitor by over $5.50. We've now led our peer group on this
metric for over two years.
Slide eight summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Between
quarters, production decreased 95,000 barrels per day. We don't show a price effects bar this quarter, as the
production impact from the $4 decrease in average Brent spot prices was negligible due the timing of cargoes.
Moving to the first bar, impacts relating to a third-party pipeline incident in Thailand negatively affected
production by 27,000 barrels per day. Repairs have been completed on the two pipelines. The larger pipeline was
back online in August and the smaller pipeline in mid-September. Gulf of Mexico tropical storms Don and Lee
decreased production by 10,000 barrels per day. Production has since been restored at all impacted facilities, and
operations have returned to normal.
Base business production decreased 64,000 barrels per day. Of this, about 30,000 barrels per day was related to a
high level of planned and unplanned maintenance in the quarter, most notably in the UK, Australia, and
Kazakhstan. Because the third quarter was a heavy turnaround quarter, as it usually is, I want to highlight that our
year-to-date decline rate is in the 3% to 4% range, consistent with our previous guidance.
Incremental production from major capital projects benefited third quarter production by 6,000 barrels per day,
primarily driven by the continued ramp-up at Frade in Brazil and Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico.
Turning to slide nine, on a year-to-date basis, our production averaged 2.68 million barrels per day. Third quarter
2011 was an obvious low in production for us. We do expect to see notably increased production during the fourth
quarter, on the order of 100,000 to 150,000 barrels per day. The key drivers of this increase are in Thailand,
pipeline repairs are complete and our production has been fully restored. In addition, we will see new production
during the fourth quarter as our Platong II asset quickly ramps up. In the Gulf of Mexico, we expect to see
improved production as hurricane season comes to an end and from Perdido as a result of recent facility
modifications. In Kazakhstan, we expect a strong fourth quarter at TCO [Tengizchevroil] now that major
turnarounds are complete and because we normally see higher production during cooler weather. And our other
significant annual turnarounds are essentially complete.
Looking beyond the quarter, I want to remind you of our long-term guidance. At the end of 2009, we said we
would grow production on average 1% per year through 2014 and then grow 4% to 5% thereafter. For the first two
years we are doing that, and I'm reaffirming our original guidance now. With the strength and scale of our major
capital projects and our strong base business performance, we continue to expect production to grow to 3.3
million barrels per day by 2017. We are advancing the queue, reaching critical milestones, and are well placed to
deliver consistent growth and performance over the long term.
Turning to slide 10, U.S. downstream earnings improved $140 million in the third quarter. Indicator margins
weakened between quarters, decreasing earnings by $225 million. Refining and marketing margins for both the
Gulf Coast and West Coast weakened relative to last quarter. On the West Coast, inventories lingered above
seasonal averages. And for both the West and Gulf Coast, gasoline demand declined at the end of peak driving
season. However, realized margins strengthened between quarters, increasing earnings by $250 million.
Pascagoula and El Segundo refineries both benefited from running more economic crude slates during the
quarter.
Higher produced volumes increased earnings by $30 million, driven mainly by the absence of second quarter
maintenance. The Other bar consists of several unrelated items, including lower OpEx and stronger trading
results.
On slide 11, international downstream earnings were also higher this quarter, increasing $802 million from
second quarter's results. Refining and marketing margins benefited earnings by $55 million due to improved
Korean marketing margins and continued strong Asian demand. Gains on asset sales improved earnings by $490
million. This includes the Pembroke refinery and related marketing facilities in the UK and Ireland. Positive
foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $240 million, primarily in our affiliates. Third quarter's foreign
exchange gain was about $145 million compared to the second quarter loss of about $95 million. The Other bar
includes a number of unrelated items.
Slide 12 covers All Other. Third quarter charges were $358 million compared to a net $183 million charge in the
second quarter, an increase of $175 million between periods. An unfavorable swing in corporate tax items resulted
in $167 million variance, and corporate charges were slightly higher by $8 million in the third quarter. Year to
date, All Other charges were $929 million. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350
million for net charges in the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward.
Mike is now going to provide an update on our downstream operations. Mike?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Jeanette. I'm pleased to have an opportunity to update everyone on our downstream performance. We
continue to focus on improving returns through a relentless commitment to operating safely and reliably and
driving improvements through all our business operations.
Please turn to slide 14. I'd like to start with an update in the area of reliability, where we now have 2010 Solomon
data. This comprehensive biennial third-party benchmarking survey shows that Chevron ranked number one
among major competitors in refinery utilization for the third consecutive period. Reliable operations are the
foundation of competitiveness. And the reduction of unplanned shutdowns enables us to capture maximum value
from our installed capacity.
I've talked to you for years now about our commitment to reliability, and this independent assessment shows the
results of that commitment. I'm extremely proud of this outcome, as it demonstrates our sustained leadership in
an essential measure of operational excellence. Year to date 2011, we've delivered utilization rates at close to 2010
levels, and our people are focused on continuing to sustain this level of performance.
Please turn to slide 15. In March, I updated you on the progress of our organizational restructuring to lower our
costs. At that time, we delivered a reduction in head count of some 20% versus a year-end 2008 baseline, largely
through work simplification and streamlining. As of the end of the third quarter, we now stand at a reduction of
34% or 6,300 people, mostly outside of the U.S. This continued progress reflects portfolio rationalization and our
significant efforts to keep our cost structure lean and competitive.
On the right-hand side of this chart, you see an update on our commitment to improve refining performance by
$700 million by the end of next year. More than a year ahead of schedule, we have exceeded our target and
captured $750 million in annual improvements. We've optimized a number of individual units across multiple
refineries, which have increased yield, lowered blend costs, and reduced lesser value product streams. At the same
time, modest investments and mechanical improvements have allowed us to lower energy, water treatment, and
catalyst costs. We'll use 2010 Solomon data to confirm the impact of these improvements and to establish targets
for additional improvement.
Please turn to slide 16. I'd also like to update you on our efforts to high-grade and simplify our portfolio to
improve focus, efficiency, and returns. We've made continued progress this year, including 21 more country exits,
primarily in Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America; eight logistics asset divestments, including six terminals
in the United States; and the sale of our UK and Ireland refining and marketing assets, including the Pembroke
Refinery.
And we still have a number of other portfolio actions in progress. We have signed sales agreements in Spain and
Africa and are in final negotiations for the sale of additional assets in the Caribbean. Since beginning this portfolio
work in 2005, we have generated more than $8 billion in cash as a result of these actions.
Turning to slide 17, we're also optimizing our business line focus, moving investment into higher return business
segments. I'd like to highlight four important lubricants and chemicals projects. In Saudi Arabia, Chevron Phillips
Chemical's Saudi Polymer Company achieved mechanical completion and is on track to start up a 1.2 million ton
per year ethylene cracker and associated derivative units. We reached final investment decision to fund the
25,000-barrel per day Pascagoula base oil plant, which when completed in 2013 will make us the world's leading
supplier of premium base oil.
We plan to expand our Oronite specialty chemicals plant in Singapore, already the largest additives plant in the
Asia-Pacific region, to increase supply capability in the fast growing Asia-Pacific market. FID is scheduled for next
year.
And Chevron Phillips Chemical is conducting a feasibility study of a world-scale ethane cracker on the U.S. Gulf
Coast that would utilize advantaged feed made available by the development of shale gas resources. CPChem has a
very strong existing position in this market and a competitive advantage in the ability to run a lighter feed slate
with more ethane than the industry in general.
On top of that, they've got excellent infrastructure and logistics capabilities and are one of the first in the industry
to advance plans for new cracker investments. With multiple facilities in the region and a proven track record of
capability and performance, we're confident that CPChem has a leg up on the right kind of projects to deliver
strong returns. We'll keep you advised as this project progresses.
Turning to slide 18, in summary we continue to operate safely and reliably and are delivering very competitive
financial results. With year-to-date adjusted earnings per barrel of $3.15 and return on capital employed [ROCE]
of 19%, we've come a long way in the last two years. Our relative competitive performance on these two measures
was strong in 2010 and continues to be strong this year, where we stand number on earnings per barrel and
number two on ROCE after nine months. We've got the right strategies and are executing on our commitments.
I'm confident we'll continue to deliver excellent performance in the quarters to come.
With that, I'd like to turn it over back to Pat.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay, thanks, Mike.

Now turning to slide 19, I'd like to close out with a few highlights of Chevron's strategic progress during the
quarter. Mike just covered our downstream progress. Clearly our plans to improve the competitiveness of our
downstream operations are well on track.
Let me cover some of the highlights on upstream now. Most recently, we achieved first production at Platong II in
the Gulf of Thailand. This natural gas project is expected to ramp up to 330 million cubic feet per day, and it will
also produce about 18,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids.
We made final investment decisions on a number of major capital projects this quarter. In Australia, we
sanctioned the Wheatstone LNG project, which along with the Gorgon project positions us to be one of the world's
leading LNG suppliers. The project cost estimate for Wheatstone is $29 billion. It is a two-train, 8.9 million ton
per year LNG facility and a domestic gas plant. We currently have about 60% of our equity LNG under long-term
sales agreements.
In the North Sea, the second phase of the Clair Ridge development received a green light. This project is expected
to cost $7.1 billion and will extend peak production and increase recovery from the Clair Ridge field.
We also sanctioned the Tubular Bells project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. First production from this $2.3
billion oil and gas development is expected in 2014, with peak production at 40,000 to 45,000 barrels per day oil
equivalent.
Our exploration activities have accelerated throughout the year. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we recently
announced the Moccasin oil discovery and spud our Coronado well. We also spud a pre-salt well in Angola. And in
offshore China, we have just begun drilling our first well in the Deepwater Pearl River Mouth Basin. In Australia,
we announced a discovery at Acme West and we have just spud our Vos well.
We are also progressing our global shale activity, with our first well currently drilling in Canada's Duvernay and
with an imminent spud of our first well in Poland.
It's clear that we're in a growth phase through mid-decade. You see this on the long-term production slide
Jeanette reviewed earlier with you, and it is reinforced as I run through these strategic milestones, where we're
evaluating newly captured acreage and continuing to sanction new development projects.
We have indicated previously that our medium-term C&E requirements would be robust, a direct result of having
such a healthy and frankly enviable development queue. For 2012, I'm not in a position just yet to offer a firm C&E
target, but you should expect a noticeable increase from current spending levels. We will be reviewing our
investment plans with our Board in just a few weeks, and we will be announcing the 2012 target investment figure
most likely in the first week of December.
In closing, the company is operating very well. Our financial performance is quite strong. Our strategies are the
right ones, and we're executing well against them. Our shareholders are benefiting from both growing dividends
and an expanding share repurchase program. We're truly excited about the value creation opportunities ahead for
us. We're committed to delivering disciplined growth and shareholder value for a long time to come.
So that now concludes our prepared remarks. Because last quarter we had several analysts who didn't get an
opportunity to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to no more than two questions. We want to be sure to
give everybody a chance this time. So now, Sean, if you could open if you could open up the lines for questions,
we'll get started.

QUESTION AND ANSWER

Q

Hey. Good morning, everyone; very strong cash flow again this quarter.

A

Hi, Ed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ed G. Westlake
Analyst, Credit Suisse (United States)

Q

Just a quick question, you've taken FID on Wheatstone and Tubular Bells. People out there do question the
returns on perhaps the initial phases of Wheatstone and the Tubular Bells project. Clearly, Wheatstone is more
strategic. But what would you say that the people might be missing you think about the returns for both of those
projects?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

I think actually both of the projects are strongly economic. You did mention the strategic aspect around
Wheatstone and there's a prospect of brownfield expansion beyond the initial commitments that we have made.
We continue to be very successful in the Australian basin in finding gas. I think we've announced 11 discoveries
over the last couple of years, so obviously it's a very prolific basin. So that will have strong returns for a very long
time to come. At the same time, the Gulf of Mexico is a strategic basin for us as well, and the economics on
Tubular Bells look strong. They're competitive in our portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ed G. Westlake
Analyst, Credit Suisse (United States)

Q

And maybe specifically on Wheatstone, obviously $29 billion total CapEx. How quickly are you going to be able to
get spend going into say 2012?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

I think that our project team was waiting for the final investment decision to be made, and they are very anxious
and ready and in fact are ramping up as we speak. And so I would expect there to be a significant ramp up there in
2012 for Wheatstone.

Q

A couple questions; first for R&M, Mike, other than say the pending sales in Spain, Africa, and the Caribbean, are
you largely done with the portfolio restructuring, or do you still have significant more to go? And also if you can
give a comment about Richmond, whether there we're going to see any focus on the upgrading there? And then
also with the Eagle Ford, the increasing NGL and the condensate production, have you guys looked at whether it
makes sense in Pascagoula or some of your facilities adding a condensate splitter to take advantage on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay, Paul. I'll take those in order. First of all on the portfolio, we've tried to lay out for you on an annual basis the
large portfolio actions that are underway or the clusters of geographies. And as I mentioned, Spain and a little bit
of Africa still is pending, with some deals signed and yet to close. We are negotiating on businesses in the
Caribbean still, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, a number of the other islands in the Caribbean, and would
expect to have deals on those signed before the end of this year and close next year. Beyond that, we'll always
continue to review our portfolio for competitiveness, but I think the big work will be completed in 2012. And if
we've got any other things that we anticipate doing here in the near term, you'll probably hear about them in
March. But we're winding this down towards the portfolio that we really believe is right for us and will allow us to
deliver sustained, very competitive returns.
On Richmond, you know the history, so I won't reprise that. We continue to be committed to investing under the
right circumstances in a project there. In May of this year, we submitted an application to the city of Richmond
restarting the environmental review process and taking clear note of the deficiencies in the prior process that were
noted by the judge in the lawsuit. We've scaled it back. We initially had a significantly larger set of projects that we
were undertaking and moving through the permitting process. The revised project will only complete the
replacement of very old hydrogen plant equipment and give us the ability to use that hydrogen both onsite at the
refinery and to export some of it to other users. We have removed a catalytic – a continuous cat re-former project
and some other power plant replacement projects, so we've scaled back.
And the other point I would make is this doesn't really change the basic function of the refinery. What it does is it
allows the refinery to remain competitive by replacing older equipment with newer, cleaner technologies to reduce
emissions and improve efficiency. We've got some of the toughest environmental laws in the world in California,
and the Richmond refinery is one of the most efficient and low emitting refineries that we have. So we believe that
this is a sound project, and frankly shouldn't be as controversial as it has become. I can't speculate on when we're
going to receive permits or when construction would continue. So we'll keep you advised as we go through that
process.

Finally on Pascagoula, Pascagoula has got a big coker, and we're investing in a lube oil plant there. And so it has
very good product flexibility and it's got good crude flexibility in terms of taking in heavier, more sour crudes to
take advantage of the discounts there. We are undertaking some further crude flexibility work to bring in other
higher viscosity crudes, higher acid crudes, but have not undertaken anything relative to a condensate splitter
there.

with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

Hi. Good morning, everybody. Pat, if I can take my full course of two hopefully quick ones. First of all, I appreciate
the update from Jeanette on timing or at least on capital, I should say, and the production outlook. However, can
you reiterate or reaffirm the timing on Gorgon because we're hearing chatter out of Australia that things might
have slipped behind schedule both on a budget and on a timing basis, so if you could reaffirm that.
And my quick follow-up I guess is to take advantage of Mike being on the line here. Mike, it looks like, at least in
our model, when we look at capture rates on the international business, and particularly in the U.S. business, that
based relative to your indicator margins, things seem to have deteriorated a little bit versus what you were able to
capture previously from the same assets. I'm just wondering if something has changed notably there that you can
share with us, and I'll leave it at that. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay, I'll take the first one there on Gorgon. We are reaffirming our timing of Gorgon, which would include first
production at the end of 2014. I think we've been pretty transparent about some of the weather related delays that
we had initially on when eight cyclones went through before we had much of the site prep work done. That has
been resolved. We've now got the housing facilities that are cyclone-proof. So should there be bad weather again,
we won't have to demobilize people on and off and remobilize people on and off the island.

We've actually made tremendous progress over the last several months. The materials offloading facility is ready
for service. That will make the logistics moving quite easy. I mentioned the housing is really – already 80% of it's
there and occupied. We've got the tankage being built. We have the wells being drilled, so there's really
tremendous progress that's being made on Gorgon. And to the extent that you hear some chatter about the
schedule slippage, as you know, we continue – there are critical path items and non-critical path items on any
major project schedule, and we feel very secure that our critical path items are right on plan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Doug, on the question on capture rates, I don't know exactly what your model is showing you. In the third quarter,
we had a very good quarter. In fact, in the U.S. we saw some significant margin deterioration. The West Coast
refining margins were off by $3 a barrel or more. And when we saw some reductions on the Gulf Coast as well –
actually, the West Coast was down $5 and the Gulf Coast was down $3, we were actually able to capture that back
and claw back. And likewise internationally, we ran pretty well earlier in the year.
And so if you're looking at year to date, we did have some issues in the first and particularly the second quarter
with some extended turnarounds at one of our facilities and a fire at another one that took a crude unit offline for
a while that had us running slates different than we normally would and selling out intermediates and buying in
intermediates, which is some things that can chew into your margins while you're operating like that. So earlier in
the year, we did have some challenges. But in the third quarter, we did well. And there's nothing material that has
changed in terms of our ability to continue to be competitive in that regard.

question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason D. Gammel
Analyst, Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.

Q

Thanks very much. First of all, I wanted to ask a question about Australia with the incremental exploration
success. Pat, maybe if you could update us on what you think the resource base that you have captured in
Australia is and contrast that with what I calculate to be about 23 Tcf you'd need to back up the two projects that
are currently under construction or at least approved.
And then a very specific one for Mike; Mike, you had mentioned a couple years ago a technology that you were
piloting in Pascagoula. It was a vacuum resid hydrocracking process with near 100% clean product yield. How is

Okay, first one on Gorgon, actually, Jason, I wish I had the slide in front of me that I'd just refer you back to.
George showed a slide at our security analyst meeting back in March where he talked to the incremental gas
quantities being found and the points in time over time when we have sanctioned these various projects. And what
you continue to see is that we continue to find additional resources both that can support an additional train for
around Gorgon and then also potentially supporting additional trains around Wheatstone. So I don't have any
incrementally new number to advise you of that. I'd just suggest that you go back and pull out that slide and note
that we have continued to have major success since March, and that George, I'm sure, will update you in March
with some rendition of that slide. But obviously, it's a very prolific gas basin, and we're very encouraged about the
exploration success that we continue to have.

And Jason, on the technology that we talked about a few years back, we continued to mature that in a pilot plant
and to very good results. We looked very hard at a couple of different locations at a pre-commercial plant that
would run at a few thousand barrels a day and prove it up so that we could scale it up. The capital costs on that
were pretty significant. And at a time when we've got a lot of other value creating capital opportunities in our
queue, and the questions today have been about a number of those, we are prioritizing our activity. And this one,
really at the scale it would take for us to answer the next set of questions as we manage our way through capital
spend, it just doesn't stack up. So we've got the technology. We've got it well covered with IP protection and will
maintain it. But at this point we have chosen not to proceed to the next step of scale-up on that.

booking this year.

Q

I'll keep it to two questions, one downstream and one on exploration. A question for Mike on your near-term
refining outlook, good quarter, good downstream quarter by the way. As I look at the European inventory, both
distillate and crude, at seven and five-year lows, U.S. day cover five low, steep backwardation in the product
market, I was wondering what your perspective was on the near-term distillate markets as well as what you're
seeing in Asia, where there's frankly inventory and demand data that are a little less transparent. And on the
Japan cargo side if you've got comments there last time you were on the call as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay, so I'll take that one and then we'll take your follow-up question. Yes, so right now sentiment seems to swing.
We have some optimism about the announcements out of Europe earlier this week. But I think overall in the
OECD, the demand side and the overall economic situation continues to be problematic, and so there is some risk.
Now you've gone to the part of the barrel where things look better, which is distillates. Japanese diesel demand
looks to be up pretty sharply. We've seen a strong draw in stocks in Japan in October. There's some talk – and
you're right. In China, things are less transparent, but there's some talk that diesel may be a little bit on the short
end there right now. And certainly as you look at the data here for the U.S., the implied diesel demand, including
exports which have become a regular part of the mix here, it's above the five-year average. We're well into the
harvest season and moving into cooler weather. So there are a number of supportive factors for distillate demand
right now, and the spreads reflect that. If you look at the NYMEX right now, distillate commands quite a healthy
premium to gasoline.

Gasoline markets look weak right now, high prices. Demand has been struggling to stay within range of what we
saw a year ago here in the U.S. And so the gasoline part of the barrel continues to be pretty weak. I think in Asia,
it's a mix, as always. There's a quote from Lee Kuan Yew that Asia is a figment of the Western imagination. I think
places like China and Singapore look very, very strong. Thailand and the Philippines right now are really
struggling with weather and the impact of the floods in Thailand and the couple of typhoons that took a pretty
direct shot at the large demand centers in the Philippines. And then there are other parts of Asia like Japan where
demand continues to be pretty weak. So overall, I think China remains the big story, and I think distillate is the
part of the barrel that we continue to see the strength in.

Q

Great, that's just great. My follow-up question is on exploration. Earlier, I noted that Cabinda and Block O has
been very prolific for Chevron. You highlighted the pre-salt well. And I think you've drilled through that salt
before, so I think it has been less uniform. But as you're highlighting that well – I presume it's a material well – I
just wondered if you could – is there something different or more prospective here? And then an update on the
Liberia spud date, maybe Bear's Hump as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Evan, there's not really much more I can offer on the Angola well. We'll just have to wait and see how that comes
out. The Liberia spud date is later here in the fourth quarter. And that, again, is in three large blocks. It's the first
well. It's highly prospective, or we hope it will be a highly prospective area. And Bear's Hump, same thing; Bear's
Hump is still drilling, and we'll have to wait and see with the outcome there is. That's Gulf of Mexico deep gas and
we'll just have to wait and see.

Q
Hey, Mike, I've got one for you relating to some of Jeanette's comments. In discussing the U.S. downstream in the
third quarter, she referenced a very, very sizable impact associated with I think she termed it a more economic
crude slate. If you do the math on those numbers, that's a big figure on a per-barrel basis. Could you talk about
what that's about and the sustainability of it; and in particular, the extent to which it's associated with market
factors as opposed to specific Chevron initiatives? And then I have a follow-up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. So the thing that I think you ought to pay attention to there, it's a 2Q to 3Q comparison, number one.
Number two, it reflects some of the challenges I referenced earlier in that earlier in the year we had some
refineries that had some issues. So we had a fire at the Pascagoula, one of our crude units at Pascagoula in the
second quarter. And so we were offline there buying higher priced intermediates to keep the back-end conversion
units full. We had some problems at El Segundo in the second quarter as well.
In the third quarter, by contrast, everything ran extraordinarily well, and we had virtually no unanticipated issues
to face. And we were able to optimize some spreads that had opened up in the market. We also have a couple of
our refineries that are smaller, Burnaby and Hawaii, that purchase a fair amount of their feedstock priced off of
WTI. And while we don't have the big WTI exposure that some of the larger midcontinent refiners do, that has
been a non-trivial factor for those refineries as well.
So you have a number of issues, some of them market related, some of them operations related, and some of them
Chevron related, all of which moved significantly to the positive in Q3, a number of which were either not nearly
as strong in Q2 or given the operational challenges actually negatives in Q2. So without trying to take you down
into a detailed breakdown on that, Mark, I would tell you that you shouldn't bank on all of that as being a
sustainable way to beat the market, but there's certainly a chunk of that that I think is.

Q

Okay, Mike. Thanks. Pat, you've been in the global LNG selling/contracting business for a while. I was wondering
if you could just comment on the trends you're seeing in the more recent LNG contracts in terms of such features
as the slope, S-curve aspects, and anything else you might want to comment on in terms of how that market is
looking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Actually, what we're seeing, frankly, is I would call it a strengthening of the midterm LNG market really with
fallout from the Fukushima circumstance. And so I would say in the medium term it has been a stronger market. I
think you can get an indication of what the various slopes have been from various publications. I don't want to go
into specifics there. But I think the contracts, we're not working off of S-curve interpretations and we feel very
comfortable about where we sit commercially. We have additional volumes that we can still place with Wheatstone
and Gorgon, frankly. And we are in discussions with numerous buyers on that, and we feel very optimistic about
our ability to find quality buyers at very good commercial terms.

Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I had two quick ones for you. One, I wanted to clarify the
production comment. If I'm not mistaken, the guidance last quarter was for full-year volumes at 2.73 million
barrels a day. And if I heard the correct number for ramp in 4Q of 100,000 to 150,000 barrels per day, it seems
like you may come in a bit light, according to my arithmetic. I'm just trying to confirm. Is that the case?

I believe.

Iain S. Reid
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

I've got a couple questions for Mike, actually. Firstly, I've got a bit of a big picture one on the downstream, Mike. If
you step back to 2009 and look at where you've come in terms of improvements in your downstream earnings, if
you split that between the portfolio actions you've done, cost reduction, and new investment, how would that
improvement break down? I'm also interested about how you see in a constant margin environment that side
improving in the future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

So that's something in March that I'll update everybody on because we've laid out some pretty specific targets
against our 2009 performance, and I just don't have a breakdown in front of me right now. I would tell you that
from a big picture standpoint, we've certainly seen margins better than what we experienced in 2009. So a portion
of what you've seen in the downstream is due to improved fundamentals out there in the marketplace. But we
have made sizable cost reductions. I spoke to you of a third reduction in head count. We have reduced our
positions in a lot of countries around the world where, frankly, we worked hard to not take a lot home, and we're
quarrying up into the areas where we really have competitive strength. So the cost side of it and the portfolio side
have been very important.
The other part is reliability, and I talked to you about our utilization rates. And we are running our assets
extremely well and better than our competitors are. And you take whatever the market has to offer you. And if you
can continue to run reliably, you can be very, very competitive. So there are contributions from the market that are
non-trivial. But there's a big, big piece of self-help that I'll talk about when we're back in New York again in March.
I just don't have a specific breakdown for you this morning. I do think that the self-help piece is intended to be
sustainable. And in the downstream, it's a margin business. The competition is tough and hanging onto the
improvements is always a challenge, which is why we continually reset targets to get even better, and I made
reference to that today in our refining system.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Iain S. Reid
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Okay, thanks, Mike. My second question is about CPChem. I just wonder whether you've got any concerns about
the new co-owner, which you're going to have there sometime next year, and whether there are any plans for any
change in the way the joint venture is set up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

This joint venture has been very successful over the decade that it has been in place. And Phillips and then
ConocoPhillips has been a very good partner, and we've been well-aligned. I think that they've indicated they
intend this to go to their downstream company. The CEO of that downstream company has been announced, and
he happens to be the former CEO of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. So he's a strong leader and somebody
who we know well and have a good relationship with.
We are having discussions with them to ensure that we remain aligned. But I can tell you that in the boardroom
and in shareholder discussions with them, we see more alignment than we see differences; that's for sure. They
will be a smaller company and they will be a company that is purely exposed to the fundamentals of the
downstream business. And so that could become an issue over time, but we'll just have to see how that plays out.

Q

Mike, thanks for being on the call. Can I ask you about Californian crude pricing and feedstock pricing from the
point of view of your position as a major producer and consumer there? I'm just thinking that things are shifting
over time quite dramatically in California. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Yes, without knowing exactly what you're referring to, I will tell you as an equity producer of heavy crude in the
San Joaquin Valley, we're seeing strong pricing for that crude today. So as an upstream producer, we're enjoying
the demand for that crude. And if you match that up with where domestic natural gas prices are, and our steam
flood there is quite economic at these kinds of natural gas prices. So it's a good place to be. There's strong demand
for that crude.
We've got options with both pipeline connections to those fields and the ability to bring in cargoes from other
markets to support our upstream with good strong runs of our equity heavy crudes and keep our refinery
competitive by taking advantage of opportunities to bring South American heavies, for instance, into Ed Segundo.
So it has been a market that I think has been good for our upstream, and it hasn't been bad for our downstream
business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

Yes, you're heading exactly where I wanted you to. On San Joaquin, I was just wondering. You said it's a demand
effect that's causing the big premium that we're seeing relative to historical premiums.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

Yes, people are setup to run these heavy crudes, and not just our refinery but other refineries that are connected to
it. And with some of the demand you see in Asia that is pulling some of the heavy crudes to Asia, the options have
changed and the reliance on certain feedstocks, particularly when you're tied to a pipeline where you can get it in
is something that you have to confront as a refiner. So I do think you've seen some shifting dynamics there, which
put a little more pressure on the refiners to be sure that they're as good as they can be and it has been healthy for
our upstream.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey

Q

Okay, great, and then my second if I could, Pat, to you. I know you hate it when I describe it as a war chest, but it
is notable that you've got over $10 billion. You've obviously done the dividend step up, which I guess is very
unusual for you to raise twice in a year. I'm not sure you haven't done it, frankly. Why not more buyback in Q4?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yes, Paul, I guess it's coming down to no matter how you give the cash away, people aren't – not everybody is
happy all the time. We felt very good about the second quarter, the second time in a year dividend increase. We
have done it in the past. Typically, when you have seen a significant run-up in commodity prices in a short period
of time, that's really what we saw here in 2011. So our cash balance for 2011 is coming in much stronger than we
thought it would be at the beginning of the year. And the dividend increase was really intended to signal
confidence in our current position as well as our future cash generating position.
We do look at the share repurchases every quarter. We do run through that through our discussion with the
Board. And at this particular time the preference was given over to dividends. We think that actually sends a
stronger signal about the performance of the company presently and really on a go-forward basis because we view
it as a permanent increase. And all I can say is we will continue to look every quarter at the cash balance. We'll
look at our medium-term outlook on prices, margins, C&E requirements. I did signal that we would have a more
noticeable uptick in C&E in 2012 relative to current spending, so all of that gets taken into account when we look
at the share repurchase decision.

Q

Good morning. I just had a question on – you mentioned the Duvernay. I was just questioning any other activities
as far as unconventional in the Lower 48 or even in Canada as far as the acreage adds go during the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Not during the quarter, no; we've continued to add significantly in unconventional properties over the course of
the last 12 and 18 months, and we've been pretty descriptive about what all those properties were. I think it was
some 15 million acres in total added over that period of time for all acreage, of which certainly unconventional gas
is a portion of that.

Q

Okay, and then just one for Mike. It looks like last week, California regulators voted to move ahead with some sort
of carbon market in California by 2013. I was just wondering what you see as the impact for Chevron there. And
are there going to be increased costs, or is that even something more that's going to be passed along to the
consumer?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Executive Vice President-Downstream & Chemicals, Chevron Corp.

A

It's a great question. California has decided to go it alone or largely alone here on climate change. The benchmark
calculations are still not clear. The first compliance period is 2013 through 2014. Transportation fuels are not
included in the first compliance period, which is where a real consumer pass-through issue will absolutely exist.
And so at this point, I think in the early portion of the program, we feel like because we have very efficient
facilities and have invested in energy efficiency that we can manage our way through the beginning, but I have to
tell you just a few facts.
California energy prices are some of the highest in the nation, whether you're talking about electricity or fuels. By
policy, this is designed to drive prices higher. And at some point, businesses have to confront that as do the
consumers of those businesses' products. And in a state where the economy is challenged, where employment is
challenged, and with a fiscal situation that is unsustainable, I think the effects here are predictable. And so we're
on a policy path in California that I think is going to need to be addressed by policymakers over time.

Pavel, I don't have a number handy. Again, I hate to – the next time I come into the call, I'll bring that slide. There
is a slide that George showed that talked about the entire Australian resource opportunity. I just have to refer you
to that. And we will update that slide come March because we have had additional success. But I don't have a
specific number for you here today.

Okay, thank you very much. I think that concludes our discussion here this morning. And let me thank everybody
for their participation on the call today. I want to thank particularly those who asked questions because I think it
enlarges the debate and the understanding for everybody. So thank you, everyone. I appreciate your interest in
Chevron.

Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's third quarter 2011 earnings conference
call. You may now disconnect.
