Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today.Welcome to Chevron's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-onlymode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given atthat time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.I will now to turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of ChevronCorporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice PresidentOkay, thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the callwith me today are Jeff Gustavson and Frank Mount, who are currently transitioning the General Manager ofInvestor Relations role. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and otherforward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two.Slide three provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's first quarter earnings were $2.6billion or $1.37 per diluted share. Excluding gains from asset sales, foreign exchange effects, and other specialitems, earnings were $0.76 per diluted share or $1.4 billion. This is a better outcome than the decline incommodity prices would have implied. This is because operationally, it was a very solid quarter for both upstreamand downstream. Production volumes were strong, and downstream asset utilization and reliability were high.Plus, operating cost control was evident throughout the enterprise.Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was approximately 10%, and our debt ratio at quarter endwas 18%.During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week we announced a dividend of $1.07 pershare payable to shareholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield about 3.8%.Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $2.3 billion for the first quarter. This reflected lowerupstream results due to the sharp decline in commodity prices as well as negative working capital effects ofapproximately $2 billion. The majority of the working capital effects are temporary in nature, and we expect theseto reverse in future quarters. These impacts were only partially offset by strong cash generation from ourdownstream and chemicals businesses.In the quarter, proceeds from asset sales totaled approximately $950 million, the majority of which re lated to thesale of our interest in multiple offshore and onshore leases in Nigeria. In February, the company successfullyexecuted a $6 billion bond offering.Cash capital expenditures were $7.6 billion for the quarter, a decrease of approximately 11% from first quarter2014 and over 20% lower than fourth quarter.At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $13 billion, and our net debt position was about$21 billion.Slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. First quarter 2015 earnings wereapproximately $1.9 billion lower than first quarter 2014 results. Upstream earnings decreased $2.7 billionbetween quarters. Significantly lower crude realizations were partially offset by positive foreign exchange effects,higher gains on asset sales, and favorable tax items. Foreign exchange gains in the first quarter were substantial,$580 million in total. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translationand do not generally affect cash.Downstream results increased by over $700 million, primarily driven by stronger worldwide refining andmarketing margins. Operationally, first quarter results were amongst the very best we've had in several years, aperfect combination of margin strength and improved refining reliability.The variance in the Other segment was primarily associated with the absence of an impairment recognized in firstquarter 2014 following the cessation of certain mining operations, primarily offset by higher tax and othercorporate charges.Turning to slide six, I'll now compare results for the first quarter 2015 with the fourth quarter of 2014. Firstquarter earnings were approximately $900 million lower than fourth quarter results. Upstream earningsdecreased by approximately $1.1 billion between quarters, reflecting lower realizations and asset sale gains,partially offset by lower impairments and operating costs.Downstream earnings were lower by $95 million. Stronger U.S. margins and lower operating expenses across theglobal system were more than offset by the absence of gains on asset sales recognized in the fourth quarter and anunfavorable swing in timing effects between quarters. The variance in the Other segment largely reflects lowercorporate charges.Jeff will now take us through the comparisons by segment.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor RelationsThanks, Pat.Turning to slide seven, our U.S. upstream earnings for the first quarter were about $900 million lower than fourthquarter's results. Sharply lower liquids realizations decreased earnings by $735 million. Our crude and liquidsrealizations all dropped by approximately 35% between periods. Gains on asset sales were lower by $330 million.In the fourth quarter, we recognized a gain following the sale of our interests in certain LPG pipeline assets, whichare associated with the upstream segment. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items. Lower operatingand exploration expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation charges, including impairments for severalsmaller assets.Turning to slide eight, international upstream earnings were about $200 million lower than last quarter's results.Significantly lower crude prices impacted earnings by $1.3 billion. Our average international crude realizationswere down over 30% between quarters, consistent with the decline in Brent prices. Lower operating expensesacross multiple countries increased earnings by $335 million.In March, the UK Government implemented a change in the petroleum tax law retroactive to the beginning of theyear, which resulted in a one-time deferred tax benefit of $350 million. The absence of impairments from theprior quarter increased earnings by $570 million, while lower gains on asset sales this quarter decreased earningsby $360 million. The Other bar included multiple components. Two notable drivers for this positive variance werestronger liftings and foreign exchange effects.Slide nine summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net o il-equivalent production between the first quarter2015 and the fourth quarter 2014. Net production increased by almost 100,000 barrels per day between quarters.Price effects increased production by 55,000 barrels per day, as lower crude prices increased cost recovery andother volumes associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts. Major capital project ramp-upsat Jack/St. Malo and Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico and from the expansion of the Bibiyana field inBangladesh increased production by 42,000 barrels per day.Planned turnaround activity was heavy in the fourth quarter, particularly at our SGI/SGP facilities in Kazakhstanas well as in Thailand and Australia. First quarter, by contrast, was much lighter in planned maintenance, and thisaccounted for higher production of 36,000 barrels per day between periods.Growth from our shale and tight assets, primarily in the Permian, contributed 10,000 barrels per day. Externalconstraints, primarily lower gas demand in Southeast Asia as well as weather-related impacts, decreasedproduction by 18,000 barrels per day. The remaining variance in the Base Business and Other bar reflects greaterunplanned downtime and other non-related items.Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production between the first quarter 2015and the first quarter 2014. Net production increased by 93,000 barrels per day between periods. Price effectsincreased production by 71,000 barrels per day, due to the roughly 50% drop in crude prices between periods.Last year, Brent averaged $108 per barrel in the first quarter. This year, Brent averaged $54 per barrel in the firstquarter.Shale and tight production increased by 43,000 barrels per day, due to growth in the Midland and DelawareBasins in the Permian as well as in the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina. Major capital projects increasedproduction by 35,000 barrels per day. Production ramp-ups in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Bangladesh,Trinidad, and Brazil were all positives. The shutdown of Angola LNG, which occurred subsequent to last year'sfirst quarter, partially offset these increases.Asset sales resulted in lost production of 34,000 barrels per day, principally driven by divestments of our assets inChad and the Netherlands. The decrease of 22,000 barrels per day in the Base Business and Other bar primarilyreflects normal field declines, partially offset by lower turnaround activity and unplanned downtime. Our basebusiness continues to perform well, with a managed de cline rate below our existing guidance.First quarter net production rate of 2.681 million barrels per day is a strong start to the year and is above the flatto 3% growth range we indicated in January as our production guidance. While this is above our guidance, it isimportant to remember that we have maintenance turnarounds and asset sales planned for later in the year.I would also like to comment on an issue we mentioned in our 10 -K about our operations in the Partitioned Zonebetween Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, where we produced 76,000 barrels per day net in the first quarter. It nowappears more likely than our future production levels in the Partitioned Zone could be negatively impacted due toour inability to secure work and equipment permits. The potential for a shutdown of production was notanticipated in our flat to 3% guidance range. We do not know for sure a production impact will occur. And if itdoes occur, we cannot estimate its duration. In any case, we estimate that the 2015 financial impact from apotential shutdown would be minimal.Turning to side 11, U.S. downstream results decreased $183 million between quarters. Importantly, theoperational results, noted in the green bars, were over $500 million stronger between periods. Margins increasedearnings by $435 million, driven by unplanned industry downtime and tight product supply on the U.S. WestCoast. U.S. Gulf Coast margins were also strong, reflecting industry refinery maintenance patterns and strongseasonal demand.Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $110 million, primarily associated with reduced turnaround andmaintenance activities. Timing effects represented a $250 million decrease to earnings, mainly due to the absenceof positive year-end inventory effects recognized in the fourth quarter and unfavorable mark-to-market swingsbetween quarters on derivatives tied to underlying physical assets. The absence of gains on asset transactionsfrom the prior quarter decreased earnings by $460 million.Turning to slide 12, international downstream earnings improved by $88 million between quarters. Lowermargins decreased earnings by $70 million. Marketing margins fell, largely the result of product pricing lag effectsevident in both Asia and Australia. Reduced operating expenses increased earnings by $120 million. Timingeffects represented a $215 million decrease to earnings. As in the U.S. segment, this represented the absence offavorable year-end inventory effects booked in the fourth quarter and adverse swings between the quarters andmark-to-market valuations on derivatives tied to underlying physical assets. The absence of a one -time charge inthe fourth quarter related to the economic buyout of a legacy pension liability increased earnings by $160 million.The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items. The largest single component was favorable foreign currencyeffects.With that, I'd like to now turn it back to Pat.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice PresidentAll right, thanks, Jeff.Turning now to slide 13, in response to the downturn, we are aggressively pursuing cost savings. Excluding fuel,operating costs in the first quarter are down 13% from the average 2014 quarter. To date, we have completed morethan 2,200 supplier engagements, with 700 more in progress. We're working across all spend categories tonegotiate supplier reductions and to rebid by contracts when sufficient reductions have not been offered. Theresults have been encouraging, with over $900 million of contract savings already negotiated.The pie chart shows upstream spend categories, though our supplier cost reduction effort and the $900 millionquoted is enterprise-wide. This represents cash savings we expect to capture in 2015. We'll see it show up as theyear unfolds in multiple ways, lower operating expenses, reduced capital outlays, and decreases in costs of goodssold. Spend categories closer to the wellhead and activities with shorter-term contracts as well as shorter cycletimes from order date to delivery date are seeing the sharpest declines. We're also seeing more immediateresponsiveness from suppliers supporting our U.S. operations.Looking externally for improvements is only part of addressing our cost structure. We're also reengineering ourinternal work processes, initiating organizational reviews, right-sizing our work teams to better match spend andactivity levels, and all of this to align with current market conditions. Our objective is a simpler, more efficient,more productive, and affordable organization that directly supports our business priorities.Finally, we are pursuing capital and operating efficiencies throughout the organization, getting more for eachdollar of spend. In the upstream, we are applying our experience with running manufact uring type operations toour shale and tight developments in the U.S. and elsewhere. This is driving significant efficiency improvementsand lowering the cost of our horizontal well programs in both the Midland and Delaware Basins.In the downstream, we are using tools like Lean Six Sigma to improve efficiency throughout our operations. In onespecific example, we've shortened the downtime by 30% associated with terminal and tank inspection andmaintenance activities, which should lead to sizable cost savings over time.Turning to slide 14, you'll recall a key commitment from our March presentation related to covering our dividendin 2017 from free cash flow. We outlined how we intended to do that, and I'd like to put a few of ouraccomplishments into that context. Cash flow growth is a near-term priority. While absolute prices in the firstquarter were not favorable, our production was. Base business performance was strong, and our base decline ratewas less than 2%. We also continued to ramp up at Jack/St . Malo in the Gulf of Mexico. The fifth well is nowonline, and gross production is up to over 70,000 barrels per day of oil -equivalent, exceeding initial expectations.We completed some critical milestones on the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects in Australia. At Gorgon, westarted up the first gas turbine generator successfully, an important step in the overall plant commissioningprocess. At Wheatstone, we successfully installed the topsides for the offshore production platform. We haveposted new pictures today, and a video of both projects will be posted early next week. I encourage you to look atthese on our investor website at chevron.com. And finally, our downstream and chemicals business is performingvery well.Reducing spend is our second priority. I've already talked through the cost structure savings we're pursuing. Inaddition to that, we're on a clear path to reduce capital spending over the next several years, as our major capitalprojects come online and our spending flexibility increases. Budgeted capital spending is planned at $35 billionthis year, a 13% reduction from 2014. Cash spending this quarter is down 11% from first quarter a year ago. By2017, we expect to have over $8 billion in additional C&E flexibility compared to 2015.And finally, we're making excellent progress on our asset sales. We realized almost $6 billion in proceeds last year,and we'll be adding nearly $4 billion to that in the first four months of this year with the recently completed leasesales in Nigeria and the divestiture of Caltex Australia. In 16 months, we've achieved almost $10 billion in totalsales proceeds versus a $15 billion 48-month target. We will continue to sell assets when we can generate goodvalue.Moving to slide 15, I'd like to close by reiterating the near-term value proposition that Chevron offers. We expectto deliver industry-leading volume growth between now and 2017. That growth is sourced from Gorgon andWheatstone in Australia, Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot in the Gulf of Mexico, and Mafumeira Sul and Angola LNG inAngola. In addition, we're poised for significant growth in our shale and tight resources, particularly in thePermian in the U.S.On top of the pure volume growth, we also offer margin expansion. The cash margins associated with theseprojects, primarily in the orange portion of the shaded bar, are projected higher than our cash margins today, andmany significantly so. By 2017, we expect our cash margins on our overall portfolio to increase by approximately35% from where they are today, assuming $60 average Brent price this year and $70 average Brent price in 2017,which is consistent with current futures prices. We believe that our outsized volume growth combined withoutsized margin growth should lead to outsized value growth for our shareholders.That concludes our prepared remarks, and I appreciate you listening in this morning. We're now ready to takesome questions. Please keep in mind that we have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and onefollow-up if necessary, and we'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. So, Jonathan, please open thelines for questions.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTIONOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ed We stlake from CreditSuisse, your question please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Edward George WestlakeCredit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QAll right. Good morning, Pat, and congratulations, Jeff, on the move, and welcome to Frank. Just I guess aquestion around cash flow to start with, thanks for shouting out the working capital. I think the market wouldhave had kittens if it was a $2 billion CFO number. Obviously, if you have net income and DD&A, you get a highernumber. I presume some of the deltas are things like dividends from associates being less than net income and thetiming of tax payments, if there's any color on that.But my general question is how does this cash flow stack up against your internal expectations for the quarter? Iappreciate obviously the oil price is very low. And has anything changed in terms of your cash flow projectionsgoing forward and what you see as a more normalized oil price?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AOkay. Thanks, Ed. I appreciate the question. I appreciate everybody's interest in cash. You're right, so it was a lowcash from operations quarter, but we did have $2 billion of adverse working capital effects. So if you added thoseback, we'd be at about $4.3 billion. What I would say is if you looked at our sensitivity on oil price relative to priorquarters and look at it this quarter, it very much is in line, and in fact it's actually a little bit stronger than just thepure sensitivity would suggest. I'll just mention the number again for everybody. It's somewhere between $325million and $350 million per dollar of Brent change. So we've had a significant drop in Brent prices and thereforea significant drop in earnings as well as cash flow.You're absolutely right, Ed, that there were some decrements relative to normal quarters in terms of the amount ofaffiliate distributions that we received. This quarter was I would say pretty minimal in terms of that. We do expectthat to turn around in the subsequent three quarters. So that's just a timing i ssue.In terms of how this looks relative to our plan going forward, if you'll recall, the numbers that we showed you inMarch, the slides that we showed you with the financial projections all assumed a $60 world for Brent, and I thinkwe're exactly in that phase. And so I look at our profile this year in terms of how earnings have come in and cashhave come in and assuming we end up at a $60 world for Brent, which looks very reasonable given where thefutures markets are, then I think we are exactly on plan and very consistent with the cash profile that we showedyou back in March. And you'll recall for everybody that we did have a significant deficit anticipated in 2015, andthen we showed you the pattern of how we would move out of that deficit out to 2017 point, getting full coverageof our dividend by 2017.I mentioned the asset sales that we have. The first quarter was nearly $1 billion, and here in April already we havethe Cal [Caltex] sale as well. So already through four months, we've got a signif icant contribution of about $4billion. So asset sales are a key component there as well.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Edward George WestlakeCredit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QThank you. I think I asked three questions in one, so I'll defer to the next in line.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs, your question,please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Neil S. MehtaGoldman Sachs & Co. QGood morning, Pat, Jeff.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AGood morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations AGood morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Neil S. MehtaGoldman Sachs & Co. QSo, Pat, I wanted you to talk through the dividend here and just how we're thinking about dividend growth.Historically, you've raised the dividend in the second quarter. Earlier this week, you kept it flat. So I wanted to seeif this represents a departure from the views on dividend growth or maybe just a change in the timing on whenyou evaluate it.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AThat's a good question, Neil. And let me just start by saying that maintaining a competitive and growing dividendis our number one priority. That has not changed. Our financial priorities have not changed. But what haschanged is our immediate financial environment. The near -term environment has changed. And so the boardchose not to increase the dividend this quarter. It is similar to what we did back in 2008 and 2009 when priceslast fell significantly. We are supporting a 3.8% yield. But clearly, we're not running very strongly on earnings orcash flow at the moment due to commodity prices.I think it's fair to say that the first quarter was not a very stable financial environment. It was very fluid in terms ofboth revenues and costs. And so I think that our overall decision is going to be based on what we feel is affordableand supportable in perpetuity because we don't want to get into a position where we're having to cut the dividendor trim the dividend in any way. And therefore, the timing and the size of an increase will be a function of howcash and earnings and asset sales, our major capital project execution, and, frankly, future commodity prices. Imean, that is a significant factor, how those all play out in the coming quarters, and really how we see commodityprices playing out over a longer sweep of time. All of those factors will influence that decision.Neil S. MehtaGoldman Sachs & Co. QThanks, Pat. And then I wanted to come back to your point on the neutral zone. And I think, Jeff, you made thepoint that the financial impact could be limited or immaterial. The number you shouted out there representsabout 3% of your volume, so curious as to why any earnings impact could be immaterial. Is that because themargins associated with those barrels could be lower? And just a broader status update on the Wafra Field wouldbe helpful as well.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AYeah, so, essentially, you're right. The financial impact is minimal because of the relationship to margins,essentially.And then on the steamflood status, we did have steam breakthrough, so we did have success in that pilot. It is ourexpectation to go into feed later this year, perhaps around the third quarter. But obviously, depending uponcircumstances and how they unfold over the next few weeks in these discussions between Saudi and the Kuwaitison the Partition Zone, there could be somewhat of an impact there. I will say that there are discussions th at areongoing, underway. This is obviously a very serious circumstance and it's being taken seriously. So we put a lot ofcould and potential and words like that in our language because we really don't know. And the hope is that thiscan get solved. We're optimistic that this can get solved.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Neil S. MehtaGoldman Sachs & Co. QThank you, Pat. And, Jeff, congratulations.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations AThank you, Neil.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line o f Phil Gresh from JPMorgan, your question,please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Philip M. GreshJPMorgan Securities LLC QGood morning, Pat. Congrats, Jeff and Frank.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations AThank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Philip M. GreshJPMorgan Securities LLC QFirst question is just on the OpEx. Thank you for the helpful color on that front. I guess what I'm wondering is aswe think about how the first quarter progressed on a year -over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis and what youcalled out relative to – I believe it was John's commentary last quarter, I think last cycle, he talked about a $4billion save number. Where do you think you are in those structural saves opportunities and how we shouldsequentially be thinking about this as we look ahead to 2Q and the second half?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President ARight. I think that our profile, at least in what we've seen so far in the first quarter, with all of the concerted andsystematic effort that we've got underway throughout the entire enterprise, I feel that we should have really goodoperating expense trends as we move through the remaining three quarters of the year. We're seeing costreductions over a whole series of cost categories anywhere from 10% to 20%. And some of that, of course, will endup in op expense. Some of it will end up in capital expenditures, lower capital outlays.But I would just say from the response on the part of suppliers, the intensity with which we are pursuing this, thefact that if we are not getting the cost reductions that we are anticipating from a given supplier, that we are willingto move market share and have done so, all of that I think bodes very well for our bottom line and our cash spendreally over the course of subsequent periods here.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Philip M. GreshJPMorgan Securities LLC QSo just a clarification on that. If you were to maybe put it in terms of innings, like what you actually realized in thefirst quarter, because I think the OpEx was down $600 million year-over-year. So I was just trying to make thatfoot with the $4 billion number and think about how far along you are versus are you actually in the early stages?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AI think we are in the very early stages in terms of what has been recognized in the first quarter results.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Philip M. GreshJPMorgan Securities LLC QOkay.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President ASo I think there's a lot of potential still to come.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations AAnd, Phil, this is Jeff. Just to be clear, the $4 billion was a 2009 number, what we saw back in 2009, nothing thatwe've put out here recently.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Philip M. GreshJPMorgan Securities LLC QUnderstood. My second question is on CPChem. I think there has been some discussion out there about thepotential to maybe more efficiently leverage that balance sheet. So maybe you could just talk about your thoughtson that and whether there's any potential of that in 2015.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AOkay, sure. In the past, CPChem has held debt. And then they've gone through a period here where they weregenerating tremendous amounts of cash and dividending that to their parents. Now they'r e in a position wherethey have investment opportunities through that U.S. Gulf Coast cracker project. And so it would not beunreasonable to think that they would go into the debt market in order to fund some of their investmentopportunities.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Philip M. GreshJPMorgan Securities LLC QOkay, great. Thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley, your questionplease.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC QHey. Good morning, everybody.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AGood morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations AGood morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC QThanks for the comment on the dividend, and maybe I'll try further there. I know in 2009 you raised the dividendin July off your typical April – May period for the raise after a moderate commodity recovery. I know there aremany factors and the board ultimately sets the dividend. What's the key metric that's your focus when you'relooking at that decision, and does it differ today at all because you're in a bigger project ramp -up period? And Ihad a follow-up, thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AEvan, I really think it's important to take a long-term view on the dividend and the outlook on cash and earningsover a longer sweep of time. So I think that is really more fundamentally the issue than where we happen to sit onour capital program at this particular point in time. And I think it's fair to say that with what's happened in oilmarkets in the last six to nine months, there is a complete reshaping of what's going on, a rebalancing of what'sgoing on. And I think it's reasonable to think that taking some time to understand where things shake out for thelong term is a very important and prudent step. I don't want to get ahead of what the board's views on this mightbe, so I can't really comment any further.The dividend is very important to us. We want to remain competitive on it . We pay attention to our yield. We payattention to our payouts on earnings and our payouts on cash flows. We want to be competitive on this. We wantto continue to grow it. So all I can say is it's got high priority and this is something that gets looked at every singlequarter, and profiles on out in terms of earnings and cash flows get looked at every quarter by the board.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC QGreat, that's fair. I appreciate that. And then a follow-up on the – particular congratulations on the Caltex sale. Onthe downstream, can you give us any idea how you expect that asset sale – those asset sales have affected yourreturns in the downstream portfolio? So as we roll forward with international, I know it wasn't non-consolidated,but how they compare relative to the rest of your portfolio and how that portfolio may look absent Caltex. Thankyou.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AI think we should comment that it had a positive contribution obviously, but I don't think it's going be noticeablein any meaningful way. Its absence will not be noticeable in any meaningful way.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC QOkay, fair enough. Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line o f Paul Sankey form Wolfe Research, your questionplease.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QHi. Good morning, everybody. And, Jeff, thank you for everything. It's been a pleasure.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations AThanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QCan I just ask about the neutral zone again? How much did you see in for volumes in your targets for this year andfor the 2017 – 3.1 million barrels a day?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President ASo this year would have been in the neighborhood of what we've produced in the first quarter here, which wasaround 7 6,000 barrels a day. We would have been anticipating a decline between 2015 and 2017 to something alittle around 60,000, maybe 62,000 barrels a day in 2017.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QGot it. And so, Pat, you're saying that basically the margins are so low there that regardless of losing whatever it is,if 60,000 – 7 0,000 barrels a day, the financial impact would literally be minimal?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AYes.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QWow, okay. That was the volume question. Is there anything to add on the California downstream market? And I'llleave it there, thanks a lot.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President ASo I think in California, we had the fortunate position of having high reliability at a time when the overall industrymarket was very tight, and it was tight for a couple of operational reasons related to other industry players. Asthose get resolved, and I think one has been resolved. One is going to take a little bit longer to resolve. But as thoseget resolved, I think you would anticipate that the margins would move towards a more normal level. Of course,second quarter is typically a reasonable margin period because of gasoline demand pickup, so there areseasonality factors there. But in general, I think it's fair to say that the West Coast margin was impactedsignificantly here in the first quarter because of these industry factors. And Chevron ran well, operated well, andwas able to take advantage of that.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QPat, it's totally obscure, but I was wondering. Was that part – was California part of the working – why was theworking capital movement so enormous in the quarter I guess is what I should have asked. Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AIt's a good question. It was really a function – when you look at our working capital elements here, the biggestdrivers really just related to a disproportionate movement in the way our accounts payable and our accountsreceivables moved over the quarter's period of time. Normal ly, when you're in a more stable price environmentthan you expect, whatever happens in your receivables and payables to offset, that did not happen in thisparticular period. And so we had a net cash consumption of size related to accounts payable/receivables net. Andthis is where I said and I feel very comfortable saying that we expect this to unwind as the quarters progress.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QI guess what I'm driving at, is the history of that typically is that the California operations have a lot of longdistance crude. Is that what we're talking about here, or was there a dollar effect or something?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President ANo, it's not what we're talking about. In the past, when we 've talked about – we've had working capital effectsrelated to California in many of those circumstances in the past that have been related to the operations, thespecific operations or lack of operations at Richmond. That is not the scenario that we're t alking about this year.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QBut I'm still not clear why it's so big. You say it's a payables/receivables type move, but I just wondered. Is it thedollar? What is it?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AIt's just the rate of activity change between what's happened on your revenue side and what's happened on yourcost side.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Benedict SankeyWolfe Research LLC QOkay, I won't belabor it. Thanks a lot.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes in line of Paul Cheng from Barclays, your question please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. QHey, guys. First, Jeff, I just wanted to say thank you for all the help over the last couple years and best of luck withyour new assignment. And, Frank, welcome aboard to IR land. Pat, on the first quarter, the cost savingsrealization in the P&L I think mentioned talking about $600 million. How much of them is related to the [ph] FX(38:26) in many of the areas that you operate? It's much weaker than the U.S. dollar, so as a results in U.S. dollarterms, the cost is down.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President ASo your question is about foreign exchange, the $600 million, roughly $580 million?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. QI'm not talking about the $580 million, which is related to [ph] currency (38:46) translation.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AYes.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. QI'm talking about the actual operating cost because let's say you pay your employee in the UK...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AYes, okay.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. Q...with the pound and then that translates into U.S. dollars. Even if the cost base remained the same in localcurrency, in U.S. dollars it's much lower. So that's the amount that I'm just curious. Out of the $600 million, howmuch is that related to that?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AIt's really not; they're not related. Our operating expense – the influence of foreign exchange on our operatingexpense is really pretty minimal through the quarter. It's more significant in terms of capital spending. But on anoperating expense base, it is not a significant component that has led to the decline in operating expense betweenperiods.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. QInteresting, so given in many of your major operating areas, the dollar has strengthened against the localcurrency, but it's not much of an impact, you say.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AThat's correct.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. QI see, okay. All right, that's fine. A final one that's real quick, ove r- lifting and under-lifting in the quarter?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AWe were about 1.7% under-lifted for the quarter.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. QAnd, Pat, at the end of the quarter, are you still under-lift, or are you about neutral or over-lift?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AI don't know. I don't know, Frank. I just know for the quarter it was 1.7%. And I don't know, Jeff.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations ANo, at the end of the quarter, Paul, we were 1.7% under -lifted. That's at the end of the quarter.Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AAt the end of the quarter, okay.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. QAnd how about for the quarter, your sales?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AWithin the quarter?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. QYes, it means that the quarter's sales comparing to the quarter production, were you over-lift or under-lift?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations AI'll have to follow up with you on that one, Paul. I don't have that number with me. But the 1.7% is...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AThe margin...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations AIs the number that you should focus on.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengBarclays Capital, Inc. QOkay, perfect. Thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America MerrillLynch, your question please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateBank of America – Merrill Lynch QThank you. Good morning, everyone. And, Jeff, let me also say thanks for all your help and welcome, Frank. I'vegot to say I'm optimistic on a better queue position with Frank. We'll see how it goes. Pat, on asset sales, you'retwo-thirds of the way through the $15 billion number. One can't help thinking there may be some upside yet againto that target. Could you frame for us how you're thinking about that? And if I could tag on a related issue, one ofyour competitors in your back yard in California seems pretty keen on asset sales. I'm just curious on the otherside of the ledger if you're taking a hard look at bolt -on deals just on your California position. And I do haveanother with you to follow up, please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President ASo we did just increase the target back in March, moving to the $15 billion over the four years. We're only sixweeks later than that approximately now. And even though the Cal sale is a significant transaction and we'rehappy to have it behind us, I'm not in a position to change the overall target. I feel very comfortable about ourability to conclude the $15 billion over the next year and a half or so that are remaining. Actually it's more thanthat, more than two and a half years, two and a half years that are remaining. So I don't want to up that target, butI feel comfortable about our ability to hit that target in the timeframe that we have said. Cal will be booked in thesecond quarter. It was not a first quarter item.And then in terms of any sort of bolt-on activity, obviously we look at circumstances, assets, and opportunitiesaround the globe. We evaluate that all the time. I'm not going to speak specifically about anything that's underconsideration or not under consideration. It has a pretty high hurdle is all I would say in order to move into ourportfolio at this time. Any sort of additional portfolio move like that would have a pretty high hurdle because itwould need to compete post-acquisition for capital against the assets that we already have in queue.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateBank of America – Merrill Lynch QI appreciate that. My follow-up is – I'm afraid I'm going to labor the working capital issue just a wee bit more, if Imay. My sense is, at least when you have such a massive move in the oil price or at least a slowdown in activitylevels that the payables that you would have as a source of working capital, as you pay those, in other words, ascash goes out the door, your subsequent payables that would replace those would be substantially lower, assumingyour activity level was reduced. So let me try and understand this. Where's your confidence or c an you help uswalk through why that after such a move in the oil price, that working capital position would reverse out if youractivity level is neutral or lower?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AI think it's really the combination. I look at these on a net basis. I look at the movement in your receivables andthe movement in your payables. And as I say, as you get into a stable environment, any sort of price impact thatyou get typically moves through both of those in a relatively synonymous way or a synchronized way. And so whenyou're in a discontinuous situation like you had in the first quarter, I think when you get into a stableenvironment, if prices have come down and cost structure has come down, then you get into a matching there.And so I think that is what I'm really trying to imply, is that as you move into that matching phase, that's whereyou will get the reversal, and you'll return to a more normal relationship between receivables and payables.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateBank of America – Merrill Lynch QIs that through the course of the year, Pat, or would you expect a quicker resolution to that? Or is it going to grindhigher or grind to rebalance over time?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AAccounts payable/receivables I would expect to begin reversing relatively quickly here. I think it's a trend, achange in the pattern that you will see in the second quarter.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateBank of America – Merrill Lynch QGreat, I'll leave it there. Thanks very much indeed.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil, yourquestion, please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Blake M. FernandezHoward Weil, Inc. QFolks, good morning. And I would also offer congratulations to both Jeff and Frank. I had two questions. One,could you give an update on the recently-formed JV you did in the Gulf of Mexico with Keathley Canyon, anystatus update or game plan as you take over operatorship there?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AI think I'd like to leave a lot of that for our second quarter here, because our plans are to have Jay Johnson on theline with us in second quarter, and I think we'll let the opportunities go there.But we're very pleased with the joint development opportunity that we've got here. This really builds on ourAnchor discovery and our Guadalupe discovery. And it combines the Tiber and Gila discoveries, where BP hadsuccess there. And so we feel like it's a very good development opportunity potentially for hubs, where you can getscale assets, economic assets, and go forward. We have a lot of continuing appraisal work to do, though. So I don'treally want to say much more than that.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Blake M. FernandezHoward Weil, Inc. QFair enough, we can follow up next quarter with Jay. The second question, Pat, is really on the U.S. in particular,where we saw negative earnings. I guess I view the Gulf and Permian as key growth areas where we would expectfairly high margins. I realize there were some impairments one-off in the quarter. But you highlight DD&A beingelevated. Is it fair to believe that DD&A remains at an elevated level until we book additional reserves over time?And if I could maybe just sneak in a follow-up on the Partitioned Zone; you mentioned the financial impact beingminimal. I presume that applies to both earnings and cash flow. But if you could please just confirm that, I wouldappreciate it. Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AYes, so just sticking with the upstream loss position, I think we have to look at what the driver was here for theloss position; obviously, very poor realizations, only $43 a barrel in liquids realizations. Gas overall was $2.25roughly. So there was a significant decline in revenues.I talked about what was happening on our cost structure side of things, but we're going to see the cost structurecome down with lag effects. You're not going to see that in a first quarter period of time. So the cost structure iscontinuing to evolve. And so first quarter, again, was not a particularly pretty picture from a margins standpoint.On depreciation, you're right. We are seeing elevated depreciation, and you would expect that depreciation toremain elevated, particularly for some of our deepwater assets, until we have time to do – we get response timeand we can see what the full recoverable – we can document the full recoverable opportunity of that developmentplay is.And back on PZ, it is the same, earnings and cash.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Blake M. FernandezHoward Weil, Inc. QGreat, thank you so much.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies, your question,please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jason D. GammelJefferies International Ltd. QThanks very much. Hi, everyone. I just wanted to come to the milestones that you've achieved in Australia over thecourse of the quarter. The first question related to the first gas into the turbine at Gorgon. That's obviously a hugemilestone. Is that being accomplished with gas from your Io-Jansz offshore, or are you getting that from thirdpartysources? And if it's not Io-Jansz, do you still expect first gas somewhere around mid-year?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AIt's coming from domestic gas sources. And, yes, our expectation really is to have – we're on schedule to haveGorgon start up in the third quarter of this year and first gas before the end of the year.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jason D. GammelJefferies International Ltd. QYou mean first commercial cargos?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AFirst commercial cargos, sorry.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jason D. GammelJefferies International Ltd. QOkay, great.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AAnd LNG before the end of the year.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jason D. GammelJefferies International Ltd. QGot it, and then obviously another major milestone achieved at Wheatstone with the topside placement. But Iguess from the schedule standpoint, I would expect that the onshore has got the most potential for slippage justfrom a risk standpoint. Can you talk about where you're at relative to schedule in terms of the onshore atWheatstone?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AYes, so we're on schedule for Wheatstone. Obviously, the installation of the topsides on the steel grav ity structurewas a major milestone. We've got seven of 24 process modules, major process modules, that have been deliveredonsite. The trunk line is installed and hydro tested. The dredging is complete. The piling activities are completed.The roofs are on both the LNG tanks, so we continue to make good progress both onshore and offshore. And I doencourage you to take a look at the pictures that are on the website, because you'll be able to see the progressthere.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jason D. GammelJefferies International Ltd. QOkay, very good. Thanks, folks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James, yourquestion, please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Pavel S. MolchanovRaymond James & Associates, Inc. QThanks for taking the question. As you were getting into 2015, presumably there was a list of FIDs that thecompany had on deck. Are there any of those, other than perhaps Kitimat, that have been pushed out orsuspended since January 1?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President ASo I would say the most significant, in fact, the only really significant FID that's on plan for this year relates toTCO and the Future Growth Project. And we continue to work that through to FID. Obviously, it's an opportunityfor us to take advantage of a lower cost structure. So we continue to do more detailed engineering and workthrough the cost estimates of this, continue to work with our partners and the government on this. So ourexpectation is fourth quarter FID on that one.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Pavel S. MolchanovRaymond James & Associates, Inc. QOkay, understood.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AAnd in terms of the other FID projects, part of the reduction that we took in our capital spending from 2014 to2015 really did relate to the pacing of other major capital projects. Kitimat is a primary one there. We've movedthat, I guess I would say the spending on that out considerably. We're really only limiting ourselves here toappraisal work and continuing to look at the design and the cost structure of that. Indonesia DeepwaterDevelopment would have been another one that has moved out. So there are several other FIDs or pre -FIDprojects that we have pushed C&E money into future years.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Pavel S. MolchanovRaymond James & Associates, Inc. QAnd if I can ask a follow-up about the downstream segment, you've been pretty vocal in the past about thefrustrations with California policy on carbon emissions in particular. Given the decision last week to extend thoserules out to 2030, does that change your view about perhaps retaining any of the California refining assets?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AI'd just say that we're in a very advantaged California position. We've got two very strong world-class, verycompetitive assets at Richmond and El Segundo. We've got very good market positions, very good brand strength.So it's a quality asset that we have here. And our expectation is that we will be able over time to work with itwhatever the regulatory framework is.At the same time, we do still think it's important to alert customers and alert government officials as to what thecost of compliance is for some of these programs. The AB-32, the cap-and-trade portion, fuels under the cap cameinto effect in January of this year. And there are costs, new costs associated with being a refiner in the state as aresult of that. Now it does get passed on to consumers. And so as that continues to move forward, then of coursethat cost increase could be something that consumers and regulators will be increasingly aware of.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Pavel S. MolchanovRaymond James & Associates, Inc. QOkay, I appreciate it.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank, your questionplease.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ryan ToddDeutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QGreat, thanks. Good morning, everybody. And let me be one of the last to wish you good luck, Jeff, in the nextassignment; and welcome, Frank. If I could just go maybe with a couple specific ones, Angola LNG, I think at theAnalyst Day you updated you expected it to come on stream during the fourth quarter of this year – back onstream; any update on progress there? That was maybe a little bit earlier than some of our expectations. An dmaybe what all did you end up having to do to the project to get it ready for this year?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AOkay. So work is still underway, significantly underway, and the overall plan is to still have A ngola LNG restartwith LNG to the tank in the fourth quarter of this year, probably late in the fourth quarter this year, and thenbegin to ramp up to about 7 5% of capacity by the first quarter of 2015. As is common, the plant will run for aperiod of time, and then ALNG will make a decision as to whether or not they need to take the plant down toperform any sort of shutdown, strainer removal, that kind of cleanup activity. And they'll decide at that point intime whether or not they want to do that early in the first part of 2016. In any case, we would expect ALNG toreach maximum capacity in the second quarter of 2016 if they decide to do those strainer removals.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ryan ToddDeutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QGreat, I appreciate that, and then maybe just one general one. I think you have a couple comments in your releasebut would appreciate any clarity as we got varying views from different companies in recent times. Any view ongeneral product demand, both in the U.S. and globally, what you're seeing across your system, any demands thatare particularly weak or strong in different parts of the system as well?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AI would say that going forward here, and I'm thinking really globally here, that product demand, there are someleading indicators that would suggest that product demand is strengthening, I guess I would say modestly, andoverall probably have an overall demand profile for 2015 that would be somewhat stronger than 2014 from an oilconsumption standpoint.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ryan ToddDeutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QAnd in the U.S., I think in your release it said that product sales were – I can't remember – they were flat year onyear versus 1Q 2014. Is that U.S. gasoline? Is that same -store sales across your system? What number is that?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AI'm not sure. Which number are you talking – are you looking at? Are you looking in the release itself?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ryan ToddDeutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QYes, I think it said branded gasoline sales were essentially flat with 2014, so I'm guessing that's same -store sales.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AIt's not, really it's networks. It's our total network sales. It's r eally just a function of our branded distributions.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ryan ToddDeutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QOkay.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AI mean our network hasn't changed significantly between periods of time.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ryan ToddDeutsche Bank Securities, Inc. QThat's helpful. All right, thanks a lot.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo, your questionplease.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D. ReadWells Fargo Securities LLC QGood morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AGood morning, Roger.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D. ReadWells Fargo Securities LLC QI guess I'd like to follow up. It hasn't gotten much air time this time around. Permian, give us an update maybewhat you're doing there, maybe your progression on rig count, and then also how the cost deflation is flowingthrough there.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AOkay. So our current outlook really for the Permian is to have about 21 rigs running currently. In the Marchmeeting we said it was something closer to 25. We expect to have about 325 gross wells this year, and that's downa little bit from what we said just a few weeks ago. Some of the reduction in the wells is due to a sh ift to horizontaldrilling programs versus vertical drilling programs. And some of it also relates to joint venture arrangementswhere our joint development partner has reduced their activity levels compared to plan.We are transitioning more and more to horizontal work as opposed to vertical work. Horizontal wells obviouslywork better in this kind of a price environment. And I would just say that we're seeing very good well -by-wellimprovement in costs in each of these wells going forward. I think the co st reduction efforts are finding their waythrough to our overall drilling and completion costs. And we'll be happy to give you a larger update, more in -depthupdate, on our second quarter call.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D. ReadWells Fargo Securities LLC QOkay. And then the other question I had, if we could get back to – it was chart 14. You talked about flexibility inyour spending going forward. I didn't catch the number, but I was just wondering if we should think about that askind of a – number one, if you could, give us a number. Number two, can we think about that as ratable as wework through, or is it very much going to be chunky as, for example, Gorgon gets going at the end of this year andobviously the CapEx drops off, and then how that may change the way the future FID process will work its waythrough as well?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President ARight. So the number that we provided between 2015 and 2017 is $8 billion cumulatively. And I think it'sreasonable for you to think about that as reasonably ratable. It does really depend and is influenced heavily by theGorgon and Wheatstone spend fall-off. But I think for purposes of what you're most likely doing, I think thinkingabout it as being reasonably ratable makes sense.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D.

Due to time constraints, our final question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBCCapital Markets, your question please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Brad HeffernRBC Capital Markets LLC QHey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bitabout how cost savings that you've realized to date have aligned with what was contemplated by your originalCapEx budget, if you're seeing cost deflation happen more quickly than you would have expected. I'm just lookingat the international CapEx number for the first quarter, and it's down $2 billion. Is that good cost savings, or isthat just normal inter-quarter volatility?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AI would say in general, the cost savings that we're seeing and that we anticipate seeing would probably besomewhat stronger than what we had baked into our $35 billion budget. And that's re ally just a function of whenwe were doing the budget and what we were anticipating versus what we believe being able to secure goingforward. I don't think you will have seen much of that in the quarter -to-quarter comparisons as of yet. So whatyou're seeing quarter-to-quarter comparisons really has more to do with the pattern of actual spending fromfourth to first.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Brad HeffernRBC Capital Markets LLC QOkay, understood. And just thinking about that, if you pro-rate the first quarter for the full year, you're alreadybelow the $35 billion number. How should we think about the CapEx trajectory throughout 2015?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President AI think you should think about it as being relatively evenly paced. The $35 billion target is what we expect to hit atthe end of the year.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Brad HeffernRBC Capital Markets LLC QOkay, thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's first quarter 2015 earnings conferencecall. You may now disconnect, good day.
