Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. Our Chairman
and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We'll refer to the slides that are available
on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2.
Now, I'll turn it over to Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

All right. Thanks, Wayne. Last March, I laid out Chevron's strategy to win in any environment, focused on four
elements that differentiate Chevron from its competitors, an advantaged portfolio, a resilience to price downside,
the commitment to capital discipline, and a superior capacity to return cash to shareholders. And as we've done in
the past, we delivered again in 2019.
We generated over $27 billion in cash flow from operations. We executed our $20 billion capital program. We
grew annual production to a record-high. We continued to high-grade our portfolio and we further strengthened
our industry-leading balance sheet.
As a result, earlier this week we increased the dividend by more than 8% and we expect to sustain the increased
share buyback rate of $5 billion per year going forward, and we did this despite the cost increase at TCO and the
fourth quarter impairments, which Pierre will cover in just a minute. 2019 performance delivered on all four of our
financial priorities, which I'll cover on the next slide.
These priorities don't change. They've been the same for a long time. For two years in a row, we simultaneously
increased our dividend, increased share repurchases, grew production, and reduced debt. Not everyone can say
this.
You can see the sources and uses of cash on the slide, including the $13 billion returned to shareholders, nearly
the same amount as our cash CapEx. 2019 was a good year and we intend to do even better. During our Analyst
Day in March, we'll layout our plans to further improve performance in order to continue to deliver superior returns
to shareholders.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierre, who will discuss our 2019 financial results. Pierre?

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide 5. Fourth quarter results included a net $9.2 billion charge in special items and a
foreign exchange loss of $256 million. Excluding special items and FX, earnings were $2.8 billion, or $1.49 per
share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the Appendix to this presentation.
Cash flow from operations was $5.7 billion. This is lower than the prior quarter, in part due to higher taxes on
repatriated cash, including the cash impact for the $430 million tax charge that was accrued in the third quarter.
Total capital spending was $21 billion. This includes around $800 million of inorganic spend, which we don't
budget, primarily relating to the purchase of the Pasadena refinery and acquisition costs for exploration leases
and additional working interest in El Trapial.
Return on capital employed was about 7% when adjusted for special items and FX. We're committed to improving
returns on capital and we'll share more about our plans to do so at our Analyst Day in March.
Importantly, our strong free cash flow enabled us to pay over $2 billion in dividends and repurchase an additional
$1.25 billion in shares in the quarter. As Mike mentioned earlier, for the full year, we returned $13 billion in
dividends and share buybacks to our shareholders, and we end the year with a stronger balance sheet and the
lowest debt ratio among our peers.
Turning to slide 6. In the fourth quarter, we recorded over $10 billion in impairments and write-offs. These were
triggered in December by our decision to reduce funding to various gas-related opportunities and to lower our
long-term oil and gas price outlook. Line item detail is available in the Appendix.
While we're disappointed by these charges, we're confident that we're making the right decisions to prioritize our
capital on our most advantaged, highest-return assets. These charges were partially offset by a $1.2 billion gain
from our UK asset sale.
Turning to slide 7. Excluding the impact of special items and FX, earnings decreased $3.6 billion in 2019
compared to the prior year. Upstream earnings declined primarily due to lower commodity prices, partially offset
by higher liftings. Downstream earnings also were down due to lower refining and chemical margins together with
lower volumes, due primarily to the Southern Africa divestment. The other segment charge, adjusted for special
items and FX, was modestly higher, but in-line with full year guidance of $2.4 billion.
On slide 8, 2019 production was a record 3.06 million barrels per day, an increase of over 100,000 barrels a day,
or more than 4% from 2018. Excluding the impact of 2019 asset sales, production grew by 5.4%, right in the
middle of our 4% to 7% guidance range.
Shale and tight production, primarily in the Permian, and the ramp-up of Wheatstone and other major capital
projects increased production by 235,000 barrels per day. This growth was partially offset by base decline and the
impact of asset sales, primarily in Denmark and the UK.
Turning to slide 9 and our reserve replacements. In 2019, our one-year reserve replacement ratio was 44%. Our
decision to reduce capital funding to Appalachia natural gas resulted in a negative revision of about 400 million

BOE of proved undeveloped reserves and asset sales reduced reserves by another 100 million BOE. Adjusting
for these two items, reserve replacement was around 90%.
Annual reserve replacements are lumpy by their nature. Five-year reserve replacement ratios are more
meaningful and ours is 106%, highlighting our continued focus and sustainability to replace the proved reserves
that we produce over the longer-term.
Moving to slide 10. Slide 10 highlights some recent commercial developments. First, we acquired an additional
15% working interest in the El Trapial field in Argentina, giving us 100% ownership of the conventional production
and the unconventional potential in this block. We also recently announced an agreement to acquire terminals
and retail sites in Australia, allowing us to further integrate our refinery production in Asia with a strong retail
network after the deal closes.
Late last year, we also signed agreements to sell our interest in our upstream assets in Azerbaijan and Colombia.
Both transactions are expected to close in the first half of this year. And a few weeks ago, we joined the Hydrogen
Council, building on our knowledge and experience with hydrogen and our commitment to explore ever-cleaner
energy solutions for the future.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Okay. Thanks, Pierre. On slide 11, we're maintaining our commitment to capital discipline, and in 2020 our capital
budget will be flat for the third consecutive year. The stacked bar depicts our organic C&E budget of $20 billion,
which includes more than $6 billion in expenditures by affiliates, primarily TCO, CP Chem, and GS Caltex.
In the 2020 budget, approximately $5 billion is allocated to our upstream base business, $4 billion to FGP/WPMP,
another $4 billion to Permian development, $3 billion for downstream and chemicals, and the remainder goes to
other MCPs, exploration, and other projects.
Chevron's capital program is unlike our peers. Our spend profile has low execution risk and is focused primarily
on short-cycle, high-return investments that are expected to sustain and grow the enterprise for many years to
come.
Slide 12 shows our production outlook for this year, assuming a $60 Brent price. We expect production to be up to
3% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2020 asset sales. Our projected growth is largely driven by
the Permian, partially offset by ordinary base declines and the effects of prior year asset sales.
The range reflects key areas of uncertainty in our business, as noted on the slide. After another year of record
production in 2019, we expect a fourth consecutive year of production growth, excluding the impact of potential
2020 asset sales.
Moving to slide 13, I'll share a few closing thoughts. As I've mentioned before, we intend to win in any
environment. We're not making excuses for tough commodity prices or margins. As a result of our advantaged
portfolio, capital discipline, low execution risk, and financial strength, we're well-positioned for 2020 and
committed to maintain organic capital spending at $20 billion and return significant cash to shareholders through
our dividend and buybacks. More detailed guidance related to the first quarter and full year is in the Appendix.


With that, I'll turn it back over to Wayne.

Wayne Borduin
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Mike. I'd like to remind everyone that we have our annual Security Analyst Meeting in New York in early
March, where we will share more about our business performance, long-term strategies, and five-year-outlook.
We're looking forward to seeing you there. For those not attending in person, it will also be available via live
webcast.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a
full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if necessary. We'll do our best to get
all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman
Sachs. Your question, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta

Q

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Hey, thank you very much, guys. The first question, and this might be one for you, Pierre, is cash flow – in the
quarter earnings looked good, cash flow a little light. It did seem like there were some one-timers in there. So can
you just spend some time talking about what some of those one-time items are and how should we think about
that rolling off as we go into the next quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, thanks, Neil. So, cash flow was a little light, perhaps. In the third quarter, we did provide guidance that we
expected to pay the taxes on the repatriated cash. So, if you recall, in the third quarter, we accrued in our P&L for
that tax effect on repatriating cash. But the cash taxes weren't actually paid until the fourth quarter, when, in fact,
you saw the cash move. So you saw cash balances go down from over $10 billion to less than $6 billion at yearend.
And then the second item I would cite was lower affiliate dividend. So we have lower dividends from our
chemicals affiliates, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, and no TCO dividend in 2019. So at times in years
past, we received a dividend from TCO in the fourth quarter and we didn't have that last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Great. And the follow-up is just on production guidance, up to 3%, and there are number of variables that you
called out there. But can you talk a little bit more about how you think about volumes in 2020? What are some of
the pluses and minuses that we should be focused on? And how we should think about thinking about some of
the timing of those elements, recognizing that you're solving for value over volume?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. Neil, I'll take that one. We've had, as I mentioned, three years of production growth, 7% I think two years
ago, 4.5% last year, 5.5% without asset sales. We continue to be on a good, strong program in our upstream
that's delivering volume growth and as we said, up to 3% this year. The Permian is the biggest piece of that and
you can see over the course of 2019 what we delivered. And we're at what I would call full factory production
mode right now in the Permian, and so that machine continues to click along very well. Jay will talk more about
that, including not only kind of the near-term view, but lay out I think a little bit of a longer-term view for you in
March.
We've got contributions from other shale and tight, where we continue to invest in both Canada and Argentina,
and those are beginning to contribute, not at the same magnitude as the Permian, but certainly strong growth.
Gorgian and Wheatstone, through improved reliability and addressing constraints and optimization within the LNG
plants. So we've got growth coming across a number of those. And, as you note there, we've got some
uncertainties on the PZ. It looks as if we will begin production there here at some point over the next few months.
There's still some details being worked out on that, but that starts to come back.
And hard to say how things go in Venezuela, really difficult to say right now. And then the other one, of course, is
non-operated joint ventures, and we certainly have some expectations for activity there. How that trends with
funding levels, decisions by partners, et cetera, a little hard to predict. But, look, we're going to – we expect to
grow production again this year, as I said, setting aside if we do anything else with asset sales in the portfolio.
And fundamentally, the underlying drivers that we laid out last March, where we said a 3% to 4% compound
annual growth rate over the next five years, those drivers remain intact.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question,
please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Philip M. Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Yes, hi. Good morning. The first question here, some of your peers seem to be signaling a return trend in
buybacks, need to protect balance sheets. Obviously, you've talked about the strength of your balance sheet and
a willingness to continue the $5 billion buyback here in 2020, despite the big increase in the dividend earlier this
week. So, as you look at that, is there any reasonable scenario where you would think it would not make sense to
do the buyback from a macro perspective? Or is this something that – I know a year ago when you put this in
place, the idea was it would stay there through most reasonable cycle, so just your latest thoughts on that. Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A

Yeah, Phil, it's Mike. No change in our expectations there. We've indicated – we increased the buyback last year.
If you look at our cash flow, you can see that we certainly can afford this. As Pierre mentioned, debt came down
again last year, and we have the capacity to see this through cycles, which is what our intent is, and no change to
that guidance at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. And if I can just build off that and address Neil's question on fourth quarter cash flow. If you look at full-year
cash flow, it was very strong. Again, we paid a higher 6% dividend per share in 2019, covered that. We fully
funded our capital program and grew production, as Mike said, over 4%. We paid down more than $7 billion of
debt. And in 2019, we bought back $4 billion of share. So, we're exiting the year confident in our ability to
generate future cash. That was expressed with the 8.4% dividend increase and, again, this expectation of
sustaining the buyback through the cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Philip M. Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Okay, great. Thanks. Mike, second question just to follow-up would be, it sounds like you've been doubling down
here on cost reduction efforts, and it's been a big focus for you recently. So, it'd be helpful if you could talk about
what's been happening lately on that front. Do you see this as something that would be material to investors in
terms of Chevron's ability to reduce costs in the upstream and/or downstream businesses in a way that we could
see? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Phil, so I may sound like a broken record on this. But in a capital-intensive business, capital discipline
always matters; and in a commodity business, cost discipline always matters. We've done a good job in taking
costs out of our business over the last several years in response to the downturn we saw earlier last decade. You
can never assume that you're done when it comes to seeking efficiency and driving to an even more efficient cost
structure.
And so, that is certainly my expectation as we're going to continue to look for ways to do that. We've taken cost
out at the same time as production has grown significantly over the last number of years, and so unit costs have
come down dramatically. And my expectation is we're going to continue to look for ways to reduce both absolute
costs and unit costs over time. In March, we'll lay out a little more specifically what some of our ambitions are on
this and the kinds of things you can expect to see.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question,
please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gammel
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Yes, thanks very much, gentlemen. Another solid year in terms of execution in the Permian. I was hoping that you
could address whether you still see the Permian as on target for being able to be essentially free cash flow
positive. The capital budget ticked up a small amount for 2020, and I know commodity prices have some influence
there. But if you could just talk about what you're seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Jason, the short answer to that is, yes, we do. We fully expect to be cash flow positive in the Permian this
year. We exited the fourth quarter with very strong production if you look at the growth Q3 to Q4. And across all
the metrics, we continue to see improved performance. We're getting more feet drilled per rig every year, lateral
lengths are increasing, EURs continue to go up, development costs continue to come down, and we are
becoming more efficient from both a capital and an operating cost standpoint. You put all that together with the
royalty barrels and the benefit of the fee acreage that we hold, and the picture in the Permian looks as strong as it
ever has. I mean, it just gets better.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gammel
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Great. And then just as a follow-up, and this may be something that you prefer to largely defer to March, but a lot
of your European peers are putting a fairly significant amount of capital into businesses that they call low-carbon,
which generally look to be relatively low rate of return type of investments. Can you talk about, within Chevron,
how you think about lowering the overall carbon footprint of your portfolio and whether these are the types of
investments that make sense for you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

So, let me start with lowering our carbon footprint, and then I'll come to investments, Jason. We absolutely are
committed to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations. Last year we announced two metrics tied to
methane emissions and flaring that are driving significant changes in what we do. We have adopted two
additional metrics, which I expect to also be included in compensation related to carbon intensity of oil production
and gas production. We are doing a lot of work around marginal abatement cost curves across our entire portfolio
to look at the intersection of technology, investment, and opportunity to reduce our carbon footprint.
We're integrating renewables into our business in a much greater way with green power purchase agreements,
feeding biofeedstocks in our refineries as soon as this year, and co-developing renewable natural gas projects
with dairy farmers, for instance. And then the final thing is we are investing in technologies, looking for things that
can scale up, that can provide solutions to these challenges. And this includes not only things like carbon capture
from ambient air, but other things to try to decarbonize the more difficult sectors where energy intensity is high.
The last thing I'll say is, just to remind you that, we operate the largest on-purpose carbon capture and storage
project on the planet at Gorgon, and we have two of the trains running right now. The third will start-up this year.
That'll, at full capacity, be sequestering 3.5 million to 4 million tons per year. So we're absolutely committed to
finding ways to address the climate issue.

When it comes to investments, it can be challenging, because the returns, as you say, historically have not been
competitive with some of the other things that we invest in our portfolio. We're looking for ways to improve that
and find things that we can invest in that would offer attractive returns for investors, also be good for the
environment, and importantly, can scale. And this is a big challenge and we need things that we can do at scale,
and so we continue to be committed to that.

please.

A

Good morning, Jeanine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeanine Wai
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Hi. I think just following-up on that question. Last month, Mike, you were quoted by saying that companies that
wait until change is forced upon them fail. And we were just wondering, are those comments specifically related to
the gas write-downs and Chevron's longer-term view on natural gas versus liquids. Or was it more broadly
speaking to Chevron's strategy related to the energy transition or else just something else?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Probably the final, the something else, and it really is. We need to continue to adapt. And our company has been
around for more than 140 years and we have reinvented ourselves many times over that period of time. We live in
a world today with 7.5 billion people. Twenty years from now, there will be more than 9 billion people on the
planet. There's an expectation for a reduction in the impact of what we do. And at the same time, we need to
support affordable, reliable access to energy for a growing population and growing standard of living.
Now, we also have technology tools that are available today that we've never seen before. And so, what we need
to do is continue to evolve our culture, our applications of technology, our cost structure, our competitiveness, and
our discipline to be part of that equation for many, many decades into the future.
And so my comments, really, are a message to our employees that we need to change, we need to evolve. And it
addresses all of the things that we've talked about. It addresses a more efficient and lower carbon intensity in our
operations, but it also calls for us to find ways to adopt new technologies and change the way we work in
response to them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q

Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. My second question is on the Gulf of Mexico and potential upside to
medium-term growth there, especially post-2023. So, with tiebacks to existing infrastructure there being very
attractive from a rate of return perspective and a portfolio, can you talk about any technology that you're working
on that could potentially extend tieback ranges? And then any update you might have on estimated resource that
we can be excited about in terms of exploiting through existing facilities or infrastructure, given the continued
focus on free cash flow?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. So, we've sanctioned a project at the end of the year, which is a greenfield project, with Anchor at a much
lower cost structure, both capital cost and operating cost, than we've seen before. So I think when we find
projects where that's the right answer, you'll continue to see us do that. And we've got a lot of exploration acreage
out there and a good track record over time on exploration.
But the concept of tiebacks, I think, is one that we need to continue to invest more in. We had a discovery last
year with Hess as the operator called Esox, a low-cost, high-return tieback, which actually will turn a 2019
discovery into 2020 first oil. It's about five miles away from Tubular Bells. We've been working on technology to
extend subsea tiebacks, and this includes longer distance pumping of fluids, compression and movement of
liquids, and the ability to avoid formation of hydrates and other things on the sea floor, pushing the range of
tiebacks from the neighborhood of 30 miles out closer to 50 miles. And that really expands the opportunity set for
us to use existing infrastructure to improve production.
We're working on multiphase subsea pumps and a number of these technologies. And so I think as we go
forward, what you will see is an increased blend of tiebacks and use of existing infrastructure, as well as the
occasional large greenfield project that comes in. And things like Anchor, for instance, you've got an initial phase
of development. And once that's in, that enables what I just described, which is these additional follow-on phases
of development, which are much more economic. And I think technology just moves in one direction and it really
builds on my prior comments that we need to look for ways to use technology standardization and other
approaches to make the deepwater even more economic. A lot of progress has been made on that and I'm
optimistic we'll see more in the future.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question,
please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

Yeah, thank you, good morning. I guess if we could, I've got kind of one that's maybe on the risk side question,
and one that's on the upside question. So the good news first. You highlighted some of the things that are risk to
2020 production, but recent talk has been about restarting the Neutral Zone. You have a position there and I was
curious where else we could see some upside in the portfolio in 2020. I mean, should we be thinking Permian, or
should we focused on some other portion of the operations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Roger, so on the Partitioned Zone, after several years of being shut down, there's been progress with an
agreement between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The Memorandum of Understanding has now been
ratified by the Royal Court in the Kingdom and the parliament in Kuwait, and we're moving on to some
administrative actions required to implement that.
All of that suggests that we should resume work in the PZ this year. It's been shut-in since May of 2015, and so
we will be careful to ensure that any start-up and resumption of activity is safe, that we really focus on equipment
integrity, and so it'll be a careful restart and a gradual ramp. And so I think in terms of production this year, we're
likely to see a start-up at some point, and then some work before we begin a gradual ramp.
So what that nets to is not a lot of impact this year, but it could be some positive upside. I think we'll see more of
the ramp completed in 2021. We eventually will have to get some new rigs in there to begin drilling additional
wells. But it should be on a trend line over the next 18 months or so back towards something that looks like we
saw before we shut down.
In terms of other upside, the Permian has kind of continually surprised us to the upside, even as we raised
expectations in the past, and so certainly that is a possibility. I mentioned the other shale and tight, and those also
continue to really show strong improvement in terms of performance, and so I think those are some other areas
where we could see production upside.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

Okay. And then for my bucket of cold water on you, we've seen global natural gas prices take quite a hit.
Obviously, fairly mild winter across the northern hemisphere hasn't helped. But part of it is your own LNG facilities
and everyone else continues to run better than expected or we've seen some start to run above nameplate
capacity. And so as we think about gas in 2020, do you feel that as we look at North America and forward curves,
that's probably a pretty good indicator of the year ahead, or is there a reason for optimism in one place or greater
pessimism in another? Just sort of curious how that would fit into your outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, overall, Roger, I think the market is, as you say, pretty tempered on gas pricing, and we have had a
relatively mild winter both in North America and in Asia, and forward markets reflect that inventory levels reflect
that. We're not banking on a recovery in gas prices. We're underweight gas as a percentage of our portfolio
versus others, and I'll remind you we've got pretty good term contracting on our LNG with oil-linked pricing across
a lot of our portfolio there.

So, from a relative weighting standpoint, we may not be quite as exposed, so maybe it was a bucket of cool water
rather than ice water that you dumped on me there. But, yeah, the markets are setting up I think to be pretty
flattish, and that's why we've got to focus on self-help and things like cost, as I discussed earlier.

Q

Mike, so integrated oil returns on capital have converged between the companies during the past decade or so,
which suggests that competitive advantages may be converging too. And on this point, while you guys have this
mantra of disciplined return-driven capital allocation, and that's clearly the appropriate approach, at least in my
view, but my question is whether you think that historical advantages and project management, multinational
experience, technological superiority, cost of capital – I'm maybe leaving something out – are still strong and
defendable for Chevron. And if so, are there examples that underscore the strength of the advantages that you
guys have? And on the other hand, are there areas of historical competitive advantage that you sense are being
eroded and where you'll need to redeploy capital away from in the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, there's a lot in there, Doug. Number one, you're right, I think we have seen this convergence of returns, in
part by the last cycle we came through, in high prices, we had a high cost structure, we had a lot of investment
across the industry. And we're now living in a world of more abundant supply and prices, and returns reflect that
with the capital sitting on the books of everybody.


I do believe the advantages that have historically been associated with the companies like ours are still strong.
And the project at Tengiz, while we wish that the execution was going better than it is and disappointed in the cost
and schedule update, there are not many companies in the world that can do a project like that at all, and so I
think there are strong advantages there. Sour gas handling capabilities, our heavy oil expertise continues to be of
value.
And as we get back to work in the PZ, we will be doing things there that very few other companies can do. And,
as I mentioned earlier, we've been hanging in in Venezuela, which has tremendous potential, and our capability
there to help over time develop that resource in a responsible way is something that is differentiated. So I think
there's some historic capabilities that are differentiators.
The other thing I would point to is portfolio. And certainly as we've talked about many times, I won't belabor it, but
our position in the Permian both from a size standpoint, a quality standpoint, the lack of – relative lack of royalty,
given the fact that it's fee acreage and our experience with factory drilling, which is a capability that not everybody
has, and we continue to see the benefits of that year after year, is another point of differentiation. So I still do
believe there are areas that we do differentiate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. And if I could build off Mike's answer there. Look, we get – and I said in my prepared remarks that our
returns are too low and we're committed to improving them, and we'll share more at our Analyst Day. But I'll also
talk about cash flow. We talked about our strong cash flow in 2019 in, call it, whichever macro environment you
want to call it, weak or whatever, but we were able to do all those things, increase the dividend, fund the capital
program, grow production, reduce debt, and sustain the buyback program.
At our last Analyst Day, we showed that over the next five years, we're going to grow cash from ops. We said
we're going to keep capital essentially flat. That means we're going to grow free cash flow. And so I think one of
the things that's not fully understood is that the capital efficiency of our program going forward is different than
we've seen in the past. So we're able to grow and sustain cash flows at lower capital than almost any time in the
past and certainly better than our peers. And that's what enables us to do the kind of dividend increase that we
announced a couple days ago, sustain a buyback program, and still grow the enterprise for the long term.

Q

[indiscernible] (00:37:56). You did a impairment charge, which was quite large and, obviously, that means the
decision made at the time, some of the parameters did not work out. So what have we learned from this process
or this impairment and how your future M&A or project sanction, the process has changed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Paul, two of the big drivers of that charge were our Marcellus position, which is essentially mostly dry gas.
We've got a little bit of Utica, but mostly dry gas. And also the Kitimat LNG project, which is Canadian gas, that is
quite a ways away from the Kitimat site. And both of those, at the time those transactions were entered into, we
and the world had a different view on natural gas. I think the Permian and unconventionals have really been a
game-changer. You look at the prolific gas production in the United States today, the market conditions that we
were talking about earlier with Roger, and we didn't see those things at the time. And so, I do think there is a
lesson about testing M&A ideas against scenarios that are not the then-prevailing view on forward markets.
We did that with the Anadarko transaction last year, and there's a reason that we – we like Anadarko from a
synergy standpoint. There's a reason we saw a certain value level that we would be willing to transact at, and
there's a reason we wouldn't go beyond that. And that's because commodity markets are hard to predict and we
certainly looked at cases that would have stressed an acquisition, because we might experience a different
market environment than the one that we premised maybe our central analysis on.
And so, Yogi Berra said predictions – I think it's Yogi Berra – predictions are hard, especially when they're about
the future. That's certainly true. It's not lost on us, and I would say that's the big lesson from these two is, if you're
going into the future with – or into a deal with a pretty strong view on commodity price, make sure you take a look
at what happens if you're wrong, and whether or not you'll be happy with it in the scenario where you are wrong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Scotia Howard Weil

Q

On the second question, I think Pierre already addressed someone. I mean, return on capital employed, last year
you earned 7% at a $64 Brent price, which is lower than the S&P market return, I think. And for most of the
investors, they probably think $60, $65 Brent is as much as they're willing to give companies in the long-term
assumption. So you're talking about a improvement. Can you give us some idea that where – given the big
portfolio you have, I mean, where that you see the biggest opportunity you may be able to really drive up that
return? I mean, we're looking at some of the project, whether it is Tengiz, the Future Growth Project, or the
Anchor, we don't see those projects would be able to improve your overall return at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Paul, look, there's no silver bullet on improving returns in a flat commodity price environment. You roll up
your sleeves and you get to work on all the little things that cumulatively can drive returns higher, and that's costs,
that's margins, that's value chain optimization, it's reliability, it's technology. There's a whole host of levers that
you have to be working on. This is what we do in the downstream business every day and what we've done in the
downstream business for decades is you assume margins are going to be worse in the future than they are today,
and you've got to find a way to get more efficient and productive with your operations in every little thing that you
do. And that's what we need to do.
I'm not satisfied with returns at the level that they are. We're not going to wait for prices to be the answer here.
We simply have to – we have to get after it, and you'll hear more about this in March. We'll talk more about our
plans to improve returns then, but there's not a magic wand here. This is good old-fashioned hard work, and it's
things that we know how to do. We just have to get after it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. And let me just add, in addition to the cost and margin and value chain and all those efforts, the Permian
investments are very accretive to our book returns. We showed in the second quarter that even in a growing asset
– and we are investing and growing in the Permian – that returns are heading to 20% and north of that. So we do
have investments that are accretive to the portfolio. I just said earlier, we have some really capital efficiency that
enables us to sustain and grow the enterprise at lower capital levels than we have in the past. So when you take
the capital efficiency, plus everything Mike talked about, we intend to increase our returns over time.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Your question,
please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gabelman
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC

Q

Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I guess this follows what Paul just said. Specifically on Anchor, it seemed
like CapEx for the project was a bit high and I was wondering if you could talk about returns. You've kind of
danced around it, but maybe talk about returns specifically for that project. And is that kind of one of the more
competitive projects in your project queue? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Jason. If I go back to an earlier period of time, our development costs for deepwater projects were north of
$30 a barrel. Anchor is actually south of $20 a barrel, and that includes some investment for new technology that
we have to prove out here, because we're dealing with deeper reservoir, higher reservoir pressures, so 20,000pound technology. A little bit of additional export pipeline, which is unique to this project as well. Operating costs
have come down from the high teens per barrel down into the range close to $10 a barrel. So we've seen
significant improvements in drilling and completions performance. And all of those things come together to bring
the cost down.
I'm not going to give you a specific return number, because, frankly, we run these things at different prices and
different assumptions around recovery. So we look at a range of potential outcomes. But I will tell you, it is
competitive in our portfolio. It sets us up for additional follow-on development that will, I think, improve returns.
And the technology development unlocks a resource type that we believe holds a lot of potential as we go
forward. And so, I don't think we're done in terms of driving these costs down. And in the deepwater, we're going
to continue to look to make these projects even more economic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gabelman

Q

Yeah. Got it. Thanks. And then there's not a lot of visibility to your project queue beyond 2025. There's a couple of
Gulf of Mexico projects, Permian, and TCO, and that's kind of all you've given us. I wonder if you plan on
providing more visibility to some of your projects that you have options around. And then kind of attached to that,
do you see an opportunity to step into some international projects, maybe with companies that are looking to
farm-down stakes? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. So we will in March lay out a longer view to give you some more transparency. I know that's a question that
a number of people have been asking. The one thing that I would suggest is we went through a period of time
over the last decade, where I think we conditioned ourselves and our investors to believe that the only path to the
future was by doing these great, big projects, and stacking up lots and lots of them, because that's what we were
doing at the time.
We have a very different portfolio today. We have large tranches of production that are pretty flat and facilitylimited in Australia LNG and Kazakhstan. Our unconventionals begin to behave this way as you build up the scale
there. And so, at the margin, we continue to look for the right projects and highly economic projects, as Pierre
said, those that are accretive to returns. But we're not nearly as reliant on those alone to sustain and grow cash
flows into the future.
We just have a much more resilient, durable, long-lived portfolio. And so grinding away on enormous
unconventional positions may not be quite as glamorous as doing the big projects in terms of giving you a lot of
things to talk about, but it really drives strong financial outcomes. And it's durable, I think longer than most people
believe. And so we'll talk about that more in March.

We'll talk about other opportunities we have in terms of captured opportunities that people may not be paying
much attention to. We'll talk more about our exploration prospects. And the question on farm-ins, that's always
something we evaluate. And if the right opportunities present themselves, we look at those.

please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Biraj Borkhataria
Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.

Q

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is actually just on the base decline. If I look at the figures on
slide 8 and take the base from there, it looks like the base decline was less than 1% in 2019, and I guess that
excludes shales. But I'm just trying to get a sense of whether that figure is relevant and if there's anything funny in
the 2019 number that is not applicable going forward. Just some comments around that would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, I mean, our base portfolio is large, and there's a lot of different assets in there. There are some things that
now are in the base that are things like Jack/St Malo and Perdido, and so we've got some of these deepwater
projects that are no longer new projects. Some of the new investments in there to do next phases of development
and the like give you some growth that offsets some of the underlying decline. But it also comes back to this point
I was just making to Jason, and a larger percent of our portfolio now is facility-limited, not reservoir-limited.
And so, this mental model that reservoir dynamics drive our overall production, the shape of our production
profile, is one I think that needs to be calibrated appropriately to a larger and larger portion that does not behave
that way. So that results in more stable, predictable production. There's modest investment required to sustain
that, be it facility investment or some new wells. But you look at that, you look at the brownfield opportunities we
have, and the ways we're using technology to arrest declines, and base decline is just less in our portfolio than it
was a decade ago, and that's not a short-term phenomenon. That's a structural change in how our production
looks.

Q

Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.

Yeah. The second question is just on a slightly different tact, but as you guys are sitting in California, I wanted to
ask about renewable fuels, given the favorable regulation there. So what we're seeing is a number of the US
refiners announce expansion projects in renewable diesel in particular. I was wondering if that's something you're
interested in. What do you think about the economics? And then, if it's attractive to you, what's holding you back
from investing in that space?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Well, we've been selling renewable fuels in California for the better part of the last two decades. A lot of blending.
We've been looking at manufacturing, but we really have chosen not to go into the ethanol business. On
renewable diesel, we've got close relationships with suppliers of renewable diesel. And we are – I mentioned
earlier in a response to a question, we are making modifications at California refining facilities in order to co-feed
biofeedstocks in order to produce renewable diesel.
So, our view is rather than going into new projects and greenfield developments, we've got existing infrastructure
and kit that we have now proven the way to safely and reliably introduce biofeedstocks in co-feed. So it's a more
economic way to do it, it takes advantage of existing capital investment, and so we're working on that. So we are
and will continue to be growing in the biofuels value chain.

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America

Q

Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Mike and the guys, Happy New Year to all
of you. Mike, I wonder if I could just hit – you know we've had some concerns about this particular issue for a
second, and it's the Permian. I'd like to just get your perspective on it.
I realize what you're saying about returns and the benefit of royalty interest and mineral interest and so on. But by
2023, this is going to be 25% of the company. And when I think about the underlying decline rates and the skew
towards NGLs and gas, given the state of the US gas market, help me understand why the increase of putting not
much of your portfolio on high decline assets and skewing towards US gas is incrementally positive for the overall
cash flow capacity of the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Doug, so look, an individual well is a high decline asset. The Permian Basin, as you get hundreds and then
thousands of wells on production and you have infrastructure built, the ability to keep that infrastructure full and
have it be a very flat production profile at modest incremental investment relative to the production that you're
producing, is profound. Jay will explain this more in March when we come to New York. But it is a factory, and
running a factory, you've got certain costs and certain investments in the factory, and then you push out the
product or the factory, and that's how to think about the Permian.
The commodity mix, look, it's 75% liquids. We're 50% oil in our portfolio right now, 25% NGLs, 25% gas. As the
volumes continue to grow, we get a lot of oil production and we take a long view on markets. Pierre mentioned
earlier that returns on investment there are greater than 20% and growing. And so, look, if we've got something at
– somebody mentioned earlier, your current returns are 7%, those need to improve. Well, if you've got
opportunities to invest in things that are north of 20%, that's a way to start to lever up returns. And so, look, we
look at the commodity prices [ph] not at all (00:54:23), we optimized it. We're moving commodities to markets
near and far to add value to that, but these are high-return, long-lived positions, and it is a competitive advantage.

Q

Okay. Thank you. My follow-up, Mike, is more philosophical, I guess, for the broader energy space. We all seem
to be here – it seems like there's been a kind of an awakening, if you like, to ESG issues just in this last past six
months, and particularly this year. More headlines this morning about pension funds just divesting out of fossil
fuels altogether. I'm just curious how in your position, obviously, as an advocate of the industry, how do you
anticipate challenging those kind of questions over fossil fuels, bad, everything else good kind of thing? How does
Chevron compete for the incremental investment dollar? And it's an answer I'm looking for some help with,
because obviously it's a challenge for all of us in this business right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. Well, first of all, we believe in ESG. We have been a responsible operator across E, S, and G for a long,
long, long time, and we invest enormously in that. The E is getting a lot of attention right now, and look, over the
history of our industry, we have – we and others have reduced the environmental impact of our operations time
and time and time again. We are doing it again today. And we have the scale, the technical capability, the
financial capability to be a big part of addressing this challenge. And no one company, no one country, no one
industry is going to be the one that solves everything, but collectively, we will respond to the challenge.
The world needs more energy. The world needs more affordable energy. And people in developing economies
deserve the opportunity to see their lives improve and affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy is essential to
improving the quality of life on the planet, which is better today than it has ever been at any point in history and
will be better in the future. And we intend to be a part of that solution. We acknowledge that the climate is
changing. We acknowledge that human activity and fossil fuels contribute to that. And we acknowledge that we
will be part of addressing that as we go forward.
And so, we were investing time, people, money, technology in being part of that solution. And, look, I'm an
optimist. There's a lot of pessimism that you can hear out there. And as you say, over maybe the last six months
that drumbeat is even louder. But we've solved big challenges in the past and I'm optimistic that we will be
successful again.

Alastair R. Syme

Q

Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. With the impairment, I guess you're signaling something about LNG. So, the
question is, are you happy to tack away completely from LNG? I mean, you've been one of the biggest global
investors in the last decade and you clearly created a lot of competency within the organization. So are you happy
to do nothing in effect?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

No, we're happy to do things that are competitive and economic, Alastair. And, look, we're a big player in LNG.
The demand for LNG will grow over time and you have to take a long view on these things. Commodity markets
get into positions where they get overbuilt, demand grows linear fashion, supply comes on in stair steps. And so,
we're in a position right now where the near-term market fundamentals are a bit tough. But long term, like
petrochemicals, like refining, you need to be in low-cost positions that are highly competitive, where you've got
scale, technology, operating efficiency. And so those are the kinds of things we're looking for and we'll continue to
evaluate opportunities to add to our LNG portfolio.
Our assessment on the Kitimat project is, given all the other developments out there in the world, that that one
was going to be tough to compete versus our alternatives. And so, this is a hard decision to come to, but it doesn't
condemn the asset class for us as an investment proposition. We just want to find the very best projects.

cost overruns and where that leaves it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Yeah. So the discussions are ongoing. The government's, obviously, key stakeholder in this, and so our people
in-country have been engaged. Jay Johnson will be there next week, and both visiting the site and meeting with
people from the government. And so, when you go through one of these things, there's a whole series of
engagements and we're in the process on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. The only thing I'd add to that, Alastair, is that unlike other agreements in Kazakhstan, our contract's tax and
royalty, right. It's not a production-sharing contract. So in production-sharing contracts, the government
reimburses the concessionaires for their cost, which is not the case for tax and royalty. So, of course, they're an
important stakeholder, but it is a fundamentally different contractual structure.

here. So, just curious on the thought process there. And as you continue to shed assets and large MCPs roll off
and capital intensity is lowered, just wondering how repeatable outsized dividend growth could be over the longterm.

So if you look back at our dividend history – and we were looking back at it not long ago – whether you're looking
over multiple decades or over the last decade, we've grown at kind of a compound annual growth rate of about
6%. And so this is a little bit to the upside of that, but we've been lower than that here in recent years and we are
well-positioned. Pierre talked about our strong cash flow and the capital efficiency that we have now in our
portfolio to sustain and grow cash flows with a much lower level of capital investment than I think people have
become accustomed to over the prior period. We would not have increased the dividend if we weren't absolutely
confident that it's sustainable in perpetuity. And just as we said, we intend to sustain our buybacks through the
cycle. We intend to sustain strong dividend distributions.
Our number one financial priority, I'll remind you, is to sustain and grow the dividend. And so, this was a signal of
confidence in our portfolio. It's a signal of confidence that we can sustain strong cash generation, even in a
commodity price environment like the one we've been in and the one we continue to be in. And we will talk about
this more in March, but we have a very, very strong position to generate cash out of our portfolio, very efficient
capital profile going forward, further efficiencies coming on the cost side, and we're very confident in the capacity
that we have. Decisions are made by the board. I can't get ahead of the board on what they may do in the future.
But I'll tell you, the board shares the confidence we have in our cash-generating capacity.

Thanks. And then just a quick one on the buybacks. You mentioned the sustainable nature. It's difficult for us to
model the impact of the PSC roll off, but it seems like very temporarily there could be at strip pricing time periods
where, in order to satisfy the full buyback, maybe you lean into the balance sheet there. Just wanted to verify the
comfort there, obviously, given where you sit as best of class on your debt ratio.

Yeah, thanks, Jamaal. No – yeah, if we have to lean on the balance sheet for some point in time, that's okay,
right? We've said we want to sustain it through-the-cycle. We've never said the buyback has to be funded every
single quarter from free cash flow. So, that's not our expectation. We have the strongest balance sheet in the
industry. Our net debt ratio is 13%, gross debt is 16%. We have the capability to take on some debt. I've talked
about we don't have a target debt range. But, certainly, I'd be comfortable higher than we are right now. But if
we're outside of – if we're a little bit low, that's okay. That's how the math works.
So, if we generate cash at surplus to our top three priorities, which is to pay the dividend, invest in the business,
and have a strong balance sheet, and we'll return that in the form of share buybacks. But we also want to keep
that ratable and sustainable, so we just don't want to ramp up buybacks, because we want to be able to
essentially dollar cost average and do it through the cycle. So the short answer is, yes, there'll be times we'll lean
on our balance sheet. Our balance sheet has that capability. And our intent is to sustain the buyback through the
cycle.
