Hey good morning, and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and
webcast. On the call with me today is George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President, Upstream
and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's
website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two.
Turning to slide three, the company's second quarter earnings were $5.7 billion or $2.98 per diluted share. On a
year-to-date basis, earnings were $10.2 billion or $5.34 per diluted share. Included in this quarter's earnings were
gains on asset sales of approximately $750 million and foreign exchange losses of $232 million, which together
equate to a positive $0.27 per share. Year-to-date earnings after netting gains, impairments and foreign exchange
impacts was $10.1 billion or $5.29 per share.

Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was approximately 12%. This reflects both the strength of
our underlying producing assets and the fact that we're in the midst of a heavy construction period for a few key
capital projects. Our debt ratio at the end of June was approximately 13%, similar to last quarter.
Our financial priorities are unchanged and we continue to reward shareholders with competitive distributions. We
repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares during the second quarter, and in the third quarter, we expect to
repurchase the same amount. Finally, Chevron's five year total shareholder return at the end of the quarter was
18.4%, which continued to lead the peer group and was also in line with the S&P 500 over the same time period.
Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $7.9 billion during the second quarter and $16.3 billion
year-to-date. Cash capital expenditures were $8.9 billion during the quarter and $17.5 billion year-to-date. At the
quarter end, our cash balances exceeded $14 billion, giving us a net debt position of $9 billion.
Slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2014 earnings were
$300 million higher than second quarter 2013 results. Foreign exchange effects negatively affected earnings by
$232 million during the quarter, representing a negative swing of over $0.5 billion between periods. As a
reminder, foreign exchange movements for us are largely book translation effects, with minimal cash flow
impacts.
Upstream earnings increased by $315 million. Gains on asset transactions of approximately $610 million in
absolute terms and higher realizations were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and higher
exploration, DD&A and operating expenses. Downstream results decreased by $45 million. Higher U.S. refining,
marketing and chemical earnings were offset by lower international refined product margins along with adverse
foreign exchange effects. Movement in the Other segment reflects an absence of a 2013 second quarter
impairment and lower corporate expenses, largely offset by higher corporate tax charges.
Turning to slide six, I'll now compare results for the second quarter of 2014 with the first quarter of 2014. Second
quarter earnings were approximately $1.2 billion higher than first quarter results. Upstream earnings were up
$957 million, reflecting gains on asset transactions, higher liftings, modestly stronger realizations and favorable
tax effects. Partially offsetting were higher exploration and operating expenses, in addition to an unfavorable
foreign exchange movement between quarters. Downstream results were essentially flat. The variance in the other
bar largely reflects the absence of the impairment and related charges from a mining asset from the prior quarter,
partially offset by higher corporate expenses.
Jeff will now take us through the comparisons by segment.

Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide seven, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the second quarter were $142 million higher
than first quarter's results. Higher production volumes at the Perdido and Caesar/Tonga fields in the Gulf of
Mexico and the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian and in San Joaquin Valley increased earnings by
$115 million. Higher exploration expenses mainly associated with the deepwater Gulf of Mexico decreased
earnings by $95 million. The second quarter included gains on several separate asset transactions worth
approximately $180 million in total. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including lower natural
gas realizations and higher operating expenses.
Turning to slide eight, international Upstream earnings were $815 million higher than last quarter's results.
Higher realizations and higher liftings increased earnings by $280 million. Our underlifted position in the first
quarter was essentially neutralized. Gains on the sale of our interests in Chad and Cameroon increased earnings
by $430 million. Lower impairments compared to the prior quarter resulted in an earnings increase of $140
million. An unfavorable movement in foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $95 million. The second
quarter had a loss of about $150 million compared to a loss of about $55 million in the first quarter. The other bar
reflects a number of unrelated items including favorable tax effects offset by higher operating and exploration
expenses.
Slide nine summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second
quarter 2014 and the first quarter 2014. Production decreased by 43,000 barrels per day between quarters. Shale
and tight resources growth contributed 6,000 barrels per day driven primarily by production increases from the
Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian. We're also seeing continued growth from the Vaca Muerta shale in
Argentina. Major capital projects decreased volumes by 13,000 barrels per day due to the shutdown of the LNG
plant in Angola, partially offset by the ramp-up at Papa-Terra in Brazil and Caesar/Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico.
Planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan, Australia and in Denmark among others, reduced production by 57,000
barrels per day. Absence of first quarter external constraints, largely weather related disruptions in Kazakhstan as
well as lower demand in Thailand increased volumes by 27,000 barrels per day. The base business and other bar
reflects normal field declines.
Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter
2014 and the second quarter 2013. Production was 37,000 barrels per day lower than the same period a year ago.
Growing volumes from our shale and tight resources, primarily driven by the Permian in the U.S. and the Vaca
Muerta in Argentina increased production by 33,000 barrels per day. Major capital projects contributed 13,000
barrels per day, driven by Usan in Nigeria and Papa-Terra in Brazil, partially offset by the shutdown of the LNG
plant in Angola. Higher turnaround activity, mainly in Kazakhstan, reduced production by 21,000 barrels per day.
Lower production entitlement effects due to lower cost recovery, higher prices and higher royalties reduced
production by 37,000 barrels per day. The base business and other bar principally reflects normal field declines.
Turning to slide 11, U.S. Downstream results increased $95 million between quarters. Stronger margins increased
earnings by $140 million, driven by tighter product supply due in part to industry refinery maintenance combined
with higher seasonal demand. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $130 million. About half of this
was due to higher costs related to shutdown and maintenance activities at the El Segundo refinery during the
quarter. The turnaround was completed at the end of June and refinery operations have returned to normal. The
remainder reflects higher maintenance and repair expenses at our other refineries and incremental costs from the
start-up of the Pascagoula base oil plant. Gains on midstream asset sales improved earnings by $40 million
between quarters. The other bar reflects a number of items including stronger chemicals results.
Turning to slide 12, International Downstream earnings decreased $84 million between quarters. Increased
volumes improved earnings by $75 million following the completion of turnarounds at our Thailand and South
Africa refineries last quarter. Lower refinery margins decreased earnings by $15 million, reflecting higher crude
costs that could not be fully recovered in the marketplace. Foreign exchange losses were approximately $55
million higher compared to prior quarter. The second quarter had a loss of about $85 million compared to a loss
of about $30 million in the first quarter. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $30 million. The other
bar includes a number of unrelated items, including minor asset transactions and lower trading results.
George will now provide an update on our Upstream operations. George?

Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

Thank you, Jeff. First, I'd like to highlight the progress on our Gorgon project. This photo shows the LNG plant in
the foreground with a jetty in the distance. We continue to make excellent progress in the module fabrication
yards and on Barrow Island. Module deliveries are continuing on schedule and we achieving our key milestones.
Gorgon remains on track for a start up next year and will be a key contributor to our production growth in 2015
and beyond. I'll share a bit more on Gorgon later. Consistent with prior quarters, we have posted additional
progress photos for both Gorgon and Wheatstone, which can be found on investor page at chevron.com.
Now let's take a look at our Upstream financial performance on slide 14. Our 2014 year-to-date Upstream
earnings margin was $20.32 per barrel. This adjusted margin does not include gains from any of our recent asset
sales in this quarter. Based on the results for our peer group through the first half of the year, we lead all our LTIP
competitors by an average of over $3.50 per barrel.
Relative to the first half of 2013, our earnings margins have softened. Foreign exchange swings reduced our
margin by $1.42 per barrel. This combined with higher exploration expense and DD&A have been the primary
contributors to this decline. We are cognizant of the current macroenvironment, increasing cost of goods and
services coupled with relatively flat commodity prices. And we remain focused on managing controllable costs.
Looking forward, we're expecting strong contributions from our new MCPs as they come online.
Now I'll discuss our 2014 production results and outlook on slide 15. Production in the first half of the year
averaged 2.57 million barrels a day at an average year-to-date Brent price of just under $109 per barrel. The first
half results are 43,000 barrels per day, or 1.7% below our guidance. Relative to our guidance, production
entitlement effects reduced production by approximately 20,000 barrels a day and the unplanned outage at
Angola LNG reduced production by a further 15,000 barrels per day.
Our base business performed well. Over the first six months of the year, we have maintained a base decline rate of
less than 3%. We also continue to see strong growth from our shale and tight assets. During the second half of
2014, we anticipate further production ramp-up at Papa-Terra in Brazil and our two Gulf of Mexico developments,
Tubular Bells and Jack/St. Malo, as these are on schedule to come online.
During the second half of the year we will perform the second of two planned turnarounds at TCO as well as
execute large turnarounds in Thailand and in the North Sea. The production entitlement effects are anticipated to
continue and we don't expect any ALNG production in the second half of the year. Completed asset sales in the
first half will of course affect second half production. We forecast 2014 production will average 98% to 99% of our
January guidance.
Our 2017 growth to 3.1 million barrels per day remains on track as we bring on our new projects and progress our
shale and tight resources. I'd like to provide you with a little more detail on the production growth which we
anticipate will occur over the next several years.
Turning to slide 16. Our peer-leading growth to 2017 is largely driven by the start-up of our major capital projects.
For the last several years, we have been in a period of high investment while our MCPs progress through the
construction phase. As these projects now transition to operations, beginning with our deepwater projects Tubular
Bells and Jack/St. Malo, we forecast significant volume and earnings growth. We remain focused on executing our
industry leading queue of projects with excellence. We have the right people and processes to deliver these
projects and we are excited about the value creation.

While many projects contribute to our growth, the majority of our new volume is generated by eight of our largest
MCPs, Gorgon and Wheatstone in Australia, Mafumeira Sul and ALNG in Angola, Papa-Terra in Brazil and
Jack/St. Malo, Tubular Bells and Big Foot in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Now I'll review progress on six of these projects. Moving to slide 17, in early April, Angola LNG experienced a
failure in the flare blow-down piping system. At the time of our first quarter earnings call, the investigation was
still underway. Following a thorough analysis, a number of design issues have been identified, which will require
modifications. In addition to the piping repairs, the LNG team will utilize this shutdown to perform capacity and
reliability enhancements to the plant. Following completion of repairs and testing, the plant will restart and it is
expected to achieve sustained production in the second half of 2015.
The Gorgon project is now more than 83% complete. All Train 1 and common modules required for LNG
operations have been delivered to Barrow Island and installed on foundations. Other downstream work on Barrow
continues to progress well with the jetty now 97% complete. And the commissioning beginning this month on
LNG Tank 1. Delivery of Train 2 modules has begun and five are now on site.
On the Gorgon upstream, hydro testing has been completed on all 660 kilometers of offshore pipelines. The well
flow-back and cleanup operations on the eight Gorgon wells is ongoing and drilling has been completed on the
10th and final Jansz-Io development well. The next major milestone is the completion of LNG Tank 1, which is
targeted for the end of this quarter.
Wheatstone is now 40% complete. Dredging, fill and piling work is progressing on schedule. The shore pull of the
main 44-inch trunkline through the micro-tunnel was completed safely and as planned. Shipments from
fabrication yards have commenced, with the delivery of the first slug catcher components to site. The Wheatstone
platform and topsides are now more than 63% complete and we anticipate the sail-away of the platform's steel
gravity structure in August. Wheatstone remains on track for a late 2016 start-up.
Now I'll review progress on our deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. Moving to slide 18. The Tubular Bells project is
nearing start-up. All key tie-ins have been installed and tested and the wells are ready for production. Production
operations are anticipated to commence in the third quarter. The remaining work on Jack/St. Malo is progressing
well and the project remains on track for a late fourth quarter start-up. Overall hookup and commissioning and
start-up progress is now 73% complete. Tie-in spools for the steel catenary risers have been installed and gas
pipeline pre-commissioning is complete. Jack/St. Malo will be a key contributor to our production growth in 2015
as production ramps up.
Big Foot shipyard related construction is over 90% complete and preparations are being made for a fourth quarter
sail-away. Fabrication work on the tension leg platform tendons is now complete and hull and topside integration
is nearing completion. The project team marked a major milestone with the heavy lifts of the drilling modules this
quarter. And as you can see in the picture on this slide, Big Foot remains on track for a 2015 start-up. We are
pleased with the progress on our key deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. As these three projects ramp up during
the next year, we will see a significant uptick in production as we move towards our 2017 goal. At peak capacity,
these projects will deliver Chevron approximately 100,000 net barrels per day.
Now I'll provide an update on our shale and tight activities. Please turn to slide 19. Chevron is the largest producer
in the Permian and has an enviable acreage position. We have the largest undeveloped leasehold and 90% of our
acreage is either low or no royalty. We have over 17,000 well prospects identified and the potential to add 8,000
to 10,000 more. Since we are not in a drill or drop situation, our approach has been to allow others to de-risk
acreage surrounding our own. This enables us to focus our capital on development wells, rather than exploration
and appraisal.

In the Midland Basin Wolfcamp play, industry drilling to date has been predominantly via vertical wells. Earlier
this summer we spud our first horizontal Wolfcamp well. We now have 17 rigs operating in the Midland Basin and
10 rigs operating in the Delaware Basin where we added two rigs this quarter. We are on schedule to drill more
than 500 wells this year in the Permian Basin.
Turning now to Argentina, Chevron is pleased with our initial results in the Vaca Muerta. Drilling results have
helped us identify two sweet spots where we are focusing our activity. In one of these areas, we have commenced a
horizontal program. We have seen a production uptick, which gives us confidence that we will deliver the growth
we anticipated when we entered this play.
Good progress is being made on our Duvernay program in Canada. Our wells have demonstrated good flow rates
and high condensate yields and we are confident of the quality of our acreage. In the third quarter, we anticipate
spudding the first of 16 wells as part of our expanded appraisal program. Also in Canada, we are continuing with
the appraisal campaign in the Liard Basin. Results continue to indicate very favorable ultimate recoveries and
high IPs, which will support our longer term plans for this asset.
Moving to slide 20, I'll now highlight a few additional ongoing activities. We continue to have good success on our
exploration program in the Carnarvon Basin in Australia. Since our announcement of Elfin-1 in April of last year,
we have made four additional discoveries. This provides us with additional gas resource and optimization
alternatives for our Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG facilities.
In March we stated a target to deliver $10 billion in asset sales over the 2014 to 2016 time period and we are on
our way to meeting that goal. Our recent divestiture of the Chad assets is one example of our focus on monetizing
a mature declining business, which allows us to generate cash for potential reinvestment in other growth areas.
We are also progressing the sale of several other mature assets including the Netherlands, our non-operated
interest in Draugen in Norway, several leases in Nigeria as well as several smaller assets from our conventional
North American portfolio. We recently achieved a major milestone at our Escravos gas to liquids plant with the
production of GTL diesel and naphtha. We anticipate continued ramp-up in first product lifting later this year.
Our exploration and development program in the Utica is yielding good results for both liquids and gas. Industry
results in the Utica shale have been encouraging, from Ohio into West Virginia and Pennsylvania. We recently
achieved a test of more than 32 million standard cubic feet per day on a 22/64 choke at one of our wells in the
emerging southern [ph] trend (25:21). We anticipate this well will be turned into line this fall.
And finally, we're also very encouraged with the initial results in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Exploratory drilling
and logging has indicated multiple play zones in a large structure. We have begun initial drill stone test and the
formations have demonstrated the ability to deliver high liquid flow rates. On one of the two wells we plan to test
up to nine different zones. We'll continue with our KRI testing program over the months ahead.
Now I'll turn it back to Pat.

Okay. Thanks, George. Turning to slide 21, I'd like to close with just a few thoughts. Global energy demand
continues to grow and satisfying that demand growth is a great business opportunity for us. We've had the same
basic strategies for a long time now. We believe they remain relevant and that they will continue to drive future
value growth for our shareholders.
We continue to focus on execution. You just heard from George that our base business in the Upstream continues
to perform well and that we are making significant progress on our major capital projects. In the Downstream, we
can also report success. The Pascagoula base oils plant, or PBOP, as we call it, is now online. First commercial
production began in June and the plant ramp-up to full production in mid July. We now the largest producer of
premium base oils worldwide.
Focus on execution also means operating safely and reliably. Through six months our personnel and process
safety performance has been strong across all the measures we typically share with you, the days away from work
rate, Tier 1 loss of containment and spills.
Sustained value creation requires reinvestment in our business. This is necessary to meet future energy demand
and is vital to sustaining growing rewards for our shareholders. We have a broad, balanced and deep queue of
investment opportunities and take a highly disciplined approach to capital allocation. We are actively managing
our portfolio and are on track to meet our stated target of achieving proceeds from asset sales of $10 billion over
the 2014 to 2016 time period. Through six months, asset sale proceeds have totaled $1.6 billion and we're making
good progress on a number of other planned transactions.
We have the best growth profile amongst the peers between now and 2017. Every quarter, as project milestones
are checked off, we get one step closer to the inflection point. Indeed, two of the projects George highlighted are
set to start up in the second half of this year and two more in 2015. Along with this sizable growth in volumes, we
expect will come significant growth in cash flows. We expect free cash flow to grow as well, thereby enabling
higher shareholder distributions over time. In short, we are very excited about what lies ahead for the company.
So that concludes our prepared remarks. I certainly appreciate you listening in this morning. We're now ready to
take some questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and
one follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered.
Jonathan, please open the lines for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit
Suisse. Your question, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Edward G. Westlake
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Q

Yes. Good morning, and thanks, George, for your time on the Upstream as well. Maybe just firstly a question on
cash flow. Last year, about $36 billion, this year $33 billion if you annualize the first half and obviously oil prices
have stayed high. I mean it looks as if your turnarounds are in high margin areas. But is there any other
deterioration in the cash flow relative to your expectations? Obviously you've given us some guidance on the
Analyst Day of relatively strong cash flow growth from the 2013 basis as these major projects come on stream.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Right. Ed, we still feel good about our cash flow projections going out 2015, 2016, 2017, and again it is obviously
predicated on the production growth that George went through on major capital projects, growth in the Permian.
And then also, of course, oil prices will be quite impactful there. If you're looking at the first half of this year
relative to the second half, I think one of the comments I would make would be Downstream. Downstream has not
been as cash-prolific, perhaps, as certainly we would like. Many of the turnarounds that we talked about on the
slide are in the rear-view mirror so to speak at this point. And so the second half of the year, we believe, should be
a better cash generation from a Downstream standpoint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Edward G. Westlake
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Q

Okay, and then a question on the Upstream just generally. I mean I'm looking at slide 10 and, of course, you're
slightly lower on production this year. But if you add up the turnaround production entitlements and base
business, you're losing some volumes but even without major capital projects, the volume trajectory is relatively
flat. And then as I look at the slide that you've put out, helpfully, on MCPs getting up to 900,000 barrels a day
from the big projects and the other stuff that you're doing and then I think about shale, it feels like something has
to get worse to miss the 3.1 million barrel a day 2017 guidance, which is a good position to be in. But I'm just
wondering, what is it that gets worse in your assumptions as you look out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Ed, I just don't have any things that get worse in our assumptions. If you remember when we came through at the
SAM meeting [Security Analyst Meeting] and gave you our forecast of 3.1 million barrels a day, we showed a
50,000 barrel a day buffer. So there is a buffer in there. And part of the reason we had that buffer in there was
always the forecasting ability but recognize that we've talked a lot more about asset sales, and we have asset sales
in our plan. We don't always know exactly what asset sales that will actually occur. We are very focused, always, on
the value proposition of those. And that's really what we've got to focus on, creating the greatest value on those
asset sales.
And as a reminder, when we look at asset sales, we're looking at two pieces. We're looking end-of-life assets; do
they have continuing investment opportunities; and then of course we look at some of our assets that are on the
front end that don't compete for funds. So we got a little bit of latitude in there to cover some of the asset sale
losses that occur when we sell these properties. But I can't give you the details on those because we are very value
driven. We're going to make the best decision on getting the greatest value for anything we sell.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Edward G. Westlake

Q

Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

And very sneakily at the end, just in terms of three questions, it's not an entitlement change as you go forward?
The pace of current entitlement changes stays flat through the forecast, do you think?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland

A

Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

Let me explain a little bit about the entitlement change in there and this probably heads off questions that we're
likely to get from others. Each year when we give you our production forecast, we have modeled and we have all
kinds of assumptions on production entitlements. We do our very best job to try to nail those entitlements. We
have a 20,000 barrel a day impact in our entitlements that are greater than what we had anticipated. We've shown
that in that section for me. You have to understand, when we model this, we have all kinds of assumption there.
I'll just deal with two of those, the two biggest ones that make up most of this 20,000 barrels a day. The two of
them are in TCO and in Bangladesh.
The TCO one, we make assumptions of how much crude we're going to move via rail versus how much crude we're
going to move on the CPC pipeline. We have that assumption. That comes up and tells us what we're going to –
gives us a really good indication of royalty net back at the wellheads. That gives us netback at the wellheads, which
impacts our royalty assumptions. This year we have moved more barrels on the CPC because it was available.
Actually about 80,000 barrels a day TCO is moved more than was in the plan. That's great for us. That's great for
Kazakhstan, great for the partnership because we get higher netbacks. We've also had higher prices on the sulfur.
And sulfur sold at a higher price translates to a higher netback for us at the wellhead also. And that reduces
production, net production. It's a really good thing for all of us. So that's really positive. So it's a value decision,
right value decision.
Similarly in Bangladesh, we've had an agreement on how we would look at VAT. VAT is now going be reimbursed
and the reimbursement will in effect reduce our cost barrels. There is a impact on that. It's good for us to clear up
the VAT issue. It's good from a profit, gas or profit oil basis going forward that removes that cost out of it. So that's
another value creator for us. Not nearly as big as the TCO one, but it's a positive for us. And those two items made
up most of the difference on this entitlement. Good things, right way to run the business, but we didn't have it
modeled that way in our plans. So and I'll tell you, we're always going to go after the piece that makes the most
value sense. Maybe that will help.

Thanks so much.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your
question, please.

Q

Hi. Good morning, everyone.


A

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

Hi, Pat. The first question I had is for George relating to the start-ups in the lower tertiary. George, you said in the
past that the key to really good returns there would be increasing recoveries from I think you plan on 10% towards
20% recoveries. What's the path towards this and the timeframe I guess towards us getting a better idea of how
those recoveries will play out? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Paul, thanks for the question. Historically, what we had actually said is we looked at recoveries initially would be
in the 8% to 10% range. And then that we saw technologies, either completion technologies, reducing back
pressure on the reservoir, items such as those technologies that would increase the recovery towards the 15% and
then onto 20%. We do believe we're on track for that. I'm going to feel a lot more confident as we get the first
Jack/St. Malo wells on and we see our new completion technology, how successful we are there. We'll be watching
production rates.
I would tell you I am encouraged at we've done the cleanup on a number of those wells already. So when the
facilities are ready, we'll be able to turn them on and we'll initially get a quick look of course at production rates. If
our production rates are at the high end of our assumption, that's going give us confidence that we're going to get
a little bit more recovery. We should actually have some pretty good confidence in that on a little bit of impact on
our recovery view, and of course we'll have a much stronger view on production volumes as we get to the end of
the year in March as we get a little bit of run time on these wells. I feel good with what we've seen on the clean-up
though. And I'll just leave it there qualitatively.

Q

Okay. Interesting. And then the follow up I had was on Gorgon start-up. When you say mid-2015, is that the first
production of gas, the first production of LNG or the first sale of LNG? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

It is the first production of LNG. It's not gas introduced into the plant. We have a target to see gas introduced into
the plant this year because we need the gas introduced into the plant to start commissioning activities. So one of
our early activities is getting gas introduced in the plant. Getting the turbine generators running. Get power
support for the operations. That utility piece is very critical to the start-up, and is actually a milestone that we'll be
talking about more in the next quarter's call.

Interesting, thanks. And you're still trying to sell more contracts there, aren't you? Is there any reason why we
haven't heard more about that given you've shown modeling of a shortage of LNG long term? I'm just surprised we
haven't heard more about contracts and I'll leave it there. Thank you.

Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

Okay. Paul, we are still looking at opportunities to sell more gas. We really don't have a lot more to sell.
Remember on the Wheatstone side, we already sit at 85%. So we're fully sold out there. As a reminder, we have
some ability to move gas in our contracts from different assets we own. So we have some flexibility there. We are
still once again looking to increase that. But we are value driven, so we need to get a price that we think is
appropriate. The spot market has been good on a seasonal basis the last year. So we feel pretty good about the
volumes if we had to move them into the spot side. Preferentially we would move them to a longer-term sales
contract if we get the right kind of pricing.

And, Paul, I would just add that with the degree of uncertainty that there is about U.S. exports and the size of U.S.
exports, I think you can understand why buyers might want to wait a little bit to see how that all lands out before
going forward to secure longer-term contracts.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. I wonder if I could follow up on Ed
Westlake's question because this is something we've been kind of wrestling with. It may be a little simplistic, but
you gave us a cartoon at the Analyst Day that showed how the cash margin improves let's say in a $110 oil
environment. So let's call that same-store sales, with last year at $36 billion. But when we take the delta on
production growth and the delta on the margin, they only add to about $8 billion to cash flow. So that gets you to
$44 billion. You're spending a little under $40 billion, your dividend are $7 billion and your buybacks are $5
billion. So can you help me with what else are you assuming in that inflection in cash flow that you talked about in
your prepared remarks? Because your Upstream guidance doesn't really seem to get us there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Are you talking about 2015 or 2017?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

No, in the cartoon it shows the post 2016 portfolio, which I assume is, if you look at [ph] 2.1 million (42:34)
barrels a day in 2017 and the current portfolio at I guess at 2.7 million barrels a day last year which generated $36
billion. I'm trying to understand how big do you think the delta is because according to your cartoon it's only
about $8 billion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, let me just start and say, I mean so we, if you start from a 2013 base and you look out to 2015, let me just be
clear on the assumptions that we have in there, so we're moving from the 2.7 million barrels a day last year to the
3.1 million barrels a day in 2017. The assumption on price in that slide was $110 a barrel Brent. And when you get
the increase in volumes and you also get an accretion on the cash margin and that accretion is coming from
significantly the major projects, major capital projects that George has just run through. Predominantly Gorgon
and Wheatstone are huge contributors to that. That is really what gives you an underlying increase in Upstream
cash flows between what we saw at the base of 2013 and what we're expecting in 2017.
On top of that, there will be we believe higher contributions in cash flows from our Downstream sector. Obviously
it's not as significant a growth element there, but there will be contributions on the chemicals side and on the
lubricant side and some on the R&M side. So when you put those components all together, we feel comfortable
about saying under those set of assumptions, particularly price and volume, you're going get to a $50 billion cash
generation figure. And I think the point that's really important here is the margin accretion that George has –
we've talked to for a couple of years here, is not just on the incremental barrels, it's on the full portfolio. And that's
really what is the compelling point here, is that those projects coming online have the capacity to pull up the entire
cash margin over the whole portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

I appreciate the answer, Pat. I'll take it offline with Jeff because like I say, I'm using your numbers and the delta
looks like $8 billion. But I'll talk to Jeff offline. My follow-up is really a Gorgon question, George. And thanks for
getting on the call this morning. You talk about start-up on Train 1. But can you talk to the ramp-up to Train 3
because obviously you're obviously familiar with the chatter that's been out there constantly while this project has
been moving forward, but start-up is one thing, but what about the ramp beyond that? Can you give us some
comfort level on the pacing of Trains 2 and Trains 3 and I'll leave it there. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Historically what we've said, we said we saw six months between train start-ups. So I'll try to give you a little more
context of what's happening between Train 2 and Train 3, and I think very frankly it's very good news on the Train
2. Modules, we expect we will have almost – well, I'll just say most of the modules for Train 2 on Barrow Island by
the end of the year. And we will even have a few we think of the Train 3 modules. So the module piece of the work
is going quite well. So it's moving forward very well. We don't see any of the module work at this point on the
critical path. So all of that puts us in a strong position to say we're not seeing any slide on time between the start-
up of Train 1 and Train 2 and if anything we may even see that tighten up a little bit. But it's a little early to go
there, so but it looks good at this point and that's a real positive. Critical for us.

Q

Hey, good afternoon guys. Just on free cash flow, it's clear, a question for George. Staying with LNG, one of your
partners, Apache, yesterday announced plans to exit Kitimat LNG and Wheatstone for that matter. I mean any
update on that project and does Apache's exit change how you think about the risk profile of that potential
project?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, let me start out on, we need to get our partnership resolved. That means Apache needs to move through the
issues and we need to get a new partner in. That needs to happen. That's I think quite obvious. As long as we keep
moving forward in the assessment of the resource in Liard, I feel very good about the resource assessment. I think
we've already can check off our confidence level on the other resources. The Horn River resources is already high.
We've really done that appraisal. So the focus on the resource side is really drilling in Liard, some appraisal work
there and getting some production work.
We think we'll actually have those wells, those first wells that we need to get some production data. We're going to
be complete with them somewhere near the end of the year. So that's a really important step for us. The other
pieces that we're spending money on on Liard, related to Liard, is a little bit of money on how we're going to
actually handle the upstream initial production, and then of course we've got to, we focus on the pipeline and the
pipeline corridor. That's important for us. We're putting some money into that to try to finalize the pipeline
routing, get all our clearances. And then we've got work at this point going on feed work, some feed work on the
plan itself. We have to understand cost and schedule on that plant. Those are the important things. We're not
spending huge money but it is a lot of money in the sense, I'm sure, for – in the terms of hundreds of millions of
dollars.
Now it's critical for us to have all of that where we can deal knowledgeably with buyers. We have to understand
cost. We have to understand resource, where we can deal with the particulars of pricing, because we're not going
to do a project unless it's economic. We've always told you, we're not going to go to FID on a project until we have
60% of the gas sold. We have to understand the project in a good sense to do that. So we've got to understand
project. We've got to understand resource. I think we're moving quite well on answering the resource issue. I am
not concerned with if Apache leaves, that there I think we could easily step in and be operator of the upstream.
Quite confident there. Apache has been very good to work with in this early stages of the assessment at Liard.
So I think we're in good shape but we need to get clarity. We need to get to closure on the partnership. And this
work I mentioned, we need to do all of that where we can deal with buyers and understand cost and understand
economics. We are very value driven. We're not going to go to an FID onto a project until we have gas sales and we
understand the economics of that sale.

Q

Great. Great, thanks. And my follow-up is on, if you could discuss Permian production in the quarter. And just
how much did that contribute to the sequential 5% increase in U.S. volumes? And then as you think about 2015,
and really bridging to the major project volumes in 2016 through 2018, I mean do you see a scope and ability to
further ramp Permian more significantly to bridge, like I said, the other major projects? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Let me start with the last part of that a little bit. Permian for us is an area we can increase investment and increase
production. We'd rather ramp up at an appropriate speed where we are very cost efficient on drilling and on a
infrastructure. So from that perspective, it is a little bit of an asset that we can gauge and move to speed.
Specifically in the quarter, I think we had a 5,000-barrel a day plus, and from the Permian area, that was good.
We're right now running, I said, 27 rigs. We have 14 verticals and 13 horizontals. So that's really good.
I gave you the numbers on the slide of how many wells that have been drilled this year and I believe that was 265.
We had told you in March this year that we were going to drill 500. You can see that we are ahead of schedule on
that. I think it's related to some efficiency we've seen in the rig operations. We've got a grand focus on reducing
cost. This business out there is frankly about two things. It's drilling cost, getting your drilling costs down and
getting your recovery up. We've got great focuses on both of those, and like I said, we're seeing the response. We're
getting a few more wells and we're getting more barrels. We like what we see. The more we continue to see that, of
course we're going to be more willing to push more money there.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Hey, guys. George, two questions if I could. On both Wheatstone and Kitimat, can you talk about, from Chevron's
position, whether that you have any interest to further increase your existing interest?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

APaul, be happy to, and maybe I'll, for everyone on the phone, I'll put in perspective a little bit, Wheatstone and our
interests relative to others and I'll try to do that on Kitimat. At the Wheatstone asset level, so this is Wheatstone
and Iago, the upstream piece of it, we hold 80% of that. Remember, you have a partnership that's between Apache
and KUFPEC that is bringing Brunello Julimar online into a common facility offshore and that our investments in
the Wheatstone project and the LNG portion of it is unitized, if you will, after that. The fields are not. But we have
a joint project from a central platform, a trunkline and into an LNG plant. And at that point, when you look at the
LNG portion of it, downstream, that portion of it, we're investing 64%. We've got all the interest we really want.
It's a high end of our interest that we would normally have in any operation. I typically like to be, when I operate,
in this 40% to 60% range. So our working interest is at the high end of that and we're quite comfortable. We don't
see any reason to have any more working interest in Wheatstone or other assets there.
Now speaking on Kitimat and I'll build off of some of those earlier comments, we hold 50% of the interest in
Kitimat, Liard, Horn River assets. That's right in the middle of the sweet spot where we like to be on working
interest, where we're committing people to run the projects and run operations. What we've told the Street in the
past, and I'll reinforce this, we actually hold 50%. I don't want any more than the 50%, and we do have available
some small amount of working interest that we would provide to an LNG buyer. And there's always been a plan for
us and Apache to have some volumes that we could – some working interest that could be sold down to buyers,
where they would be a part of the development, and they would be in the full value chain. That has not changed.
And I'm not looking to increase our working interest beyond the 50%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Second question. If I'm looking at page 16 of the presentation, next year the major project, the current expected
increase is 150,000 barrels per day. Your base operation previously assumed a 3% underlying decline curve.
Assume that has not changed, that translate to roughly about 80,000 barrels per day drop year-over-year. So that
means that based on this particular graph, it would suggest, it seems to imply your expected production growth on
next year about 2% to 3%, get to about 2.65%. Don't know whether you can give us a number? What is your
current projection for 2015? Or if not, can you tell us that whether there's any other things that we should take
that into consideration in this calculation?

Let me speak qualitative to this. First off, we give you our commitment commitment number guidance in January
each year. So in January 2015, we'll give you our guidance. I will only give a few qualitative comments about
you've done the numbers right relative to the MCPs. Our base decline is running in this 3% or less. That's true. We
haven't yet given you guidance on two other items and I would tell you, we're working that at this point in time,
how many barrels are we going to have on our shale and tight. We've got investments going in shale and tight in
the Permian. That's [ph] not (57:38) in this number. How well is Vaca Muerta going to actually perform, so we've
got those two that are significant and we've got to identify those as we go through our business plan process.

And of course we've got another one that we haven't told anyone, and we haven't even ourselves haven't decided
on which assets we're going to sell. So we've got some sales that are going to occur. We're once again value driven,
so I don't know which ones are the ones that we're going to end up and sell. What's the whole value of them for us
versus what will someone else pay on these late-life assets So those are the two aspects that I can't really answer at
this point in time. But we will be able to give you an answer in January.

Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Thanks, everyone. I wanted to come back to Gorgon if I could. George, if I was interpreting your comments
correctly, it seems that critical path on Train 1 would be more delivering first gas on the island and commissioning
work on the train itself and also the utilities. Can you confirm that's correct? And when you think about the risks
towards meeting that mid-2015 objective, where would you put labor amongst those and what's your labor
contract situation? I'm just thinking in light of what's happening on Curtis Island right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland
Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Let me start off on the critical path items going for us. ME&I is critical for start-up. That is heavily dependent on
labor productivity. We've got over 5,000 people working on the island. It's all about for us getting as much of that
effort focused on the ME&I piece of it. And I guess I would add one other thing. And we don't find any unknown
problem. As we get closer and closer to start-up, and this is true for every project that everyone does in the world,
it's these unknowns that you just frankly don't know what's going to come up, and is it something that is easily
mitigated or is it something not. And we don't ever know that until we get them all done.
The good news is every day you get closer, you eliminate more and more of them. And at being at 83%, we've
already eliminated a lot of them, like logistics we know is not a critical path. We were worried about the jetty. It's
not the critical path. So we're eliminating those every day. So big milestones that we'll report out on in the
following quarters. An example of a big one that we're going to, the tank. We want to make sure we got LNG Tank
1 ready. Often on LNG projects, the tanks are the critical path. We're just about to the point to say LNG Tank 1,
with it being complete it's not going be on the critical path. I mentioned ME&I, one of the big next ones for us is
the start-up of our turbine generators. We've got all five of our generators there on the island. The next big step
and a big important step for us milestone is of course power. We get the power running, that puts us in a great
position on the commissioning and that's something we'll talk about on our next call.
So we'll keep giving you this information as we click them off. And I do encourage everyone since this is being
brought up again is take a look at some of those photos that we have. I think they really give you a flavor of what
work is being completed.

And George, just where do you sit in terms of labor contracts? Or excuse me, what has some of the contractors
said in terms of their labor contracts? And do you have any changes to cost estimate? I think I know the answer to
that one. And would you expect to do a Wheatstone cost evaluation at the 50% completion mark like what you did
with Gorgon?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland

I would actually think that we're going to probably see a little bit low slower ramp-up on those. Remember, these
are very high pressure wells. The last thing we want to do is do any damage to the completion. So we're going to be
very focused and I would say probably a little bit on the cautious side on the ramp-up these and make sure we
really understand what's happening at the face of the completion.

Ryan Todd

Q

Great. Thanks, everybody. If I could follow up on earlier question in terms of the pace to the onshore. If we look at
what your performance, I mean I think over the past 12 months, the biggest bar on the growth side was from your
tight and shale assets. You've got extreme high quality positions in the Permian and Argentina and a number of
other places. And given the volatility of performance in some international and offshore assets on timing and the
smoother profile and the returns on the onshore side, is there a case to be made, not just over the next 12 months
but over the next five years to reallocate more capital in that direction and away from some of the other projects?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

George Lawrence Kirkland

A

Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

We'd have to look at it on a portfolio basis and that's what we do each and every year as we build a new three-year
business plan and actually a longer strategic plan. When you have a portfolio that has lots of options out there, you
can move things in and out quite easily, but it takes a portfolio that's got these options available. We do that each
and every year. We don't like to jerk any of our businesses around. We like to keep our rig counts. If they're
growing, we like to keep them growing in a gradual manner, not a big spurt. We are more efficient when we do
that and of course we have to balance all that with our capital programs.
We don't have an infinite amount of capital spend so we try to get our capital focused on how we can get the best
returns. So we're going to I guess high-grade our view going forward of how we want to spend our money in our
business plan each year. We told you at our Analyst Meeting, the next three years we're going to be really capital
flat, pretty capital flat. That means we're going to be looking at how we get the most value out of that capital we
spend. My anticipation is that we'll continue to see a little more money continuing to go to the Permian Basin.
But the Permian Basin or these other shale plays cannot offset the impact of these big projects either. We need all
of that in our portfolio to grow. We must have all the big projects and frankly, what the continuous plays give us,
they give us another piece that's more continuous in growth and a nice part to have in your portfolio and we're
going to grow that a little bit over time. So it's going to give us a little more flexibility as we go forward.

Irrespective of what happens with Apache. We're driven by once again having a sales contract or sale contracts
that give us 60% to 70% of the gas committed.

Okay, thank you. Before we close the call, I'd like to mention that going forward, we will no longer be issuing an
interim update. For those of you who have followed us for some time, you will know that we have modified the
format of our update over the past few years in an effort to have it be a clear and effective document. I have to say
that that effort has not met with 100% success. Rather, many investors have suggested that it has not been all that
helpful or insightful and at times has added confusion rather than clarity. That's not a good place to be and hence
our decision to stop the practice. We do remain committed though to full disclosure and transparency. And as we
have in the past, we'll strive to be very candid and clear in describing company performance in our earnings
releases and our earnings calls and our 10-Ks and our 10-Qs and in all of our other investor outreach activities.
I'd like to thank everybody for your time today. We truly appreciate your interest in Chevron. Jonathan, back to
you.
