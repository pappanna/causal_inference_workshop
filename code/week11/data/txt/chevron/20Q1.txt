Wayne Borduin
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thank you, Jonathan. And welcome to Chevron's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Our
Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We'll refer to the slides that are
available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2.
Now I'll turn it over to Mike.

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

All right. Thanks, Wayne. Before we get started, I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. Our
thoughts are with all the families affected by COVID-19 and especially with the health care workers on the front
lines battling every day to contain the outbreak.
I'm also incredibly grateful to our employees, who show up for work every day, particularly those out in the field,
operating critical facilities to provide the energy that supports the pandemic response and keeps essential goods
and services flowing in support of the economy. They too are heroes.
During our Security Analyst Meeting in March, we discussed Chevron's resilience. And now it's time for us to
demonstrate it.
No one foresaw these specific market conditions. But we were prepared for them. We know what to do, and we're
doing it, as we execute this five-point action plan.
First and foremost, we're focused on the safety of our employees and our operations. Next, we're exercising the
flexibility in our capital program. Today, we're further lowering our full year guidance.
In addition to capital, costs always matter in a commodity business. We initiated a major company restructuring
last year. And we expect to drive additional savings this year and next.
Capital structure also matters. We came into this crisis with an industry leading balance sheet. And we're taking
actions intended to maintain financial strength.

Lastly, while addressing current market conditions, we're preserving long term value for shareholders, employees,
and other stakeholders. I'll speak to each element of this action plan in the following slides, beginning with safe
and reliable operations on slide 4.
We've had fewer than 50 confirmed cases of employees with the virus. And nearly all cases appear to have been
contracted outside the workplace.
Most of our office based employees are able to work from home. For those who continue working at facilities or in
the field, we've implemented multi-layer screening, distancing, hygiene, and PPE protocols. Our COVID-19 testing
capability is ramping up.
Finally, we're helping our communities with donations of money, PPE, and other things we can manufacture, like
sanitizers in our plants and 3D printed face shields.
In downstream, our refineries are running well below capacity to meet significantly lower product demand. Where
possible, we're prioritizing equity crudes into our refining system and re-optimizing our plans for turnarounds.
In upstream, the rig count will be down by about 60% by the end of this quarter. In May, we expect to curtail
between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels of oil-equivalent production. And we expect curtailments to continue in
June. LNG contract sales have been unaffected.
Despite some logistics challenges, our supply chains have been functioning with no major disruptions. We're
closely monitoring financial risks to our suppliers and working with them on win-win solutions.
Now I'll give an update on our major project under way in Kazakhstan. Despite the early COVID outbreak in
Korea, module fabrication and shipments out of the fabrication yard remain on schedule. In fact, only seven
modules remain in the yard, and all are scheduled to depart this quarter.
Restacking of the modules in Tengiz is progressing well and was ahead of schedule at the end of April.
That said, the pandemic is presenting challenges. Restrictions on the movement of people and goods and
positive COVID cases in six of the more than 100 residential camps in Tengiz have triggered changes.
While critical path construction activities proceed, we're temporarily demobilizing noncritical path personnel. As a
result, we anticipate some degree of impact to project cost and schedule. But it's too early to quantify this in any
meaningful way.
Our forecast of 2020 capital expenditures for the project has been reduced by about $1 billion, our share, due to
deferred activity, cost mitigations, and expected currency benefits.
Turning to our overall capital outlook. We're further lowering our full year 2020 organic capital guidance to as low
as $14 billion, down from $16 billion announced in March. Second half CapEx could be as low as $6 billion or a
run rate up to 40% lower than our original budget. The incremental reductions since our March press release are
primarily focused on TCO and short cycle investments.
Turning to slide 7. In response to current market conditions, we expect to reduce operating costs by about $1
billion this year relative to 2019, due to reduced activity levels, lower fuel costs, and curtailment of other
discretionary expenditures.


Beyond the current year, our initiative outlined at the Security Analyst meeting to lower OpEx by another $1 billion
next year is progressing well. A portion of these savings will come from restructuring, where we expect design to
be finalized this quarter with the streamlined organization in place by year end.
Costs often lag during market corrections. We were already working on further cost reductions before these
conditions began and intend to keep pace with today's realities.
Turning to the next slide. The chart on left shows our estimated sources and uses of cash under a two year stress
test with sustained prices of $30 Brent. Our decision to suspend the repurchase program, lower costs, and flex
capital down will reduce the pull on our balance sheet.
The chart on the right shows we have the debt capacity to weather this stress test better than our peers. All our
actions are consistent with our long standing financial priorities. And number one is to protect the dividend, which
we know is vital to our shareholders.
Turning to slide 9 and the fifth element of our action plan, preserving long term value. While we have the flexibility
to take capital even lower, we're focused on the right spending to ensure that existing assets are safe and
reliable, projects already under construction are efficiently completed, operational and technical capabilities are
maintained, investment options are preserved for the future, and we maintain our commitment to ESG priorities.
During a market downturn, the playbook in our industry isn't a secret. The key is how you execute it. The winners
are the one that make the right choices, best balancing short term cash flow and long term value. We made the
right choices coming into this crisis. And we intend to exit in the best position among our peers.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre.

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide 10. First quarter earnings were $3.6 billion or $1.93 per share. Adjusted earnings,
which excludes special items and foreign exchange, were $2.4 billion or $1.29 per share. A reconciliation of nonGAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.
Cash flow from operations was $4.7 billion and total capital spending was $4.4 billion. In the quarter, we also
increased our dividend and repurchased $1.75 billion of shares before suspending the share repurchase program.
Turning to cash flow. Excluding working capital, cash flow from operations covered the dividend and cash CapEx
in the first quarter, yielding a dividend breakeven under $50 Brent. Proceeds from the sales of our interest in
Malampaya were offset by loans to TCO. Given volatile market conditions, we're holding more cash and ended
the quarter with a net debt ratio of 14%.
Turning to the next slide. First quarter earnings of $3.6 billion increased about $1 billion versus the same quarter
last year. Included in the current quarter was a gain on the sale of upstream assets in the Philippines and
favorable tax items.
Adjusted upstream earnings decreased due to the lower prices, partially offset by higher production. Adjusted
downstream earnings increased primarily due to favorable timing effects and higher marketing margins. The other
segment decreased primarily due to lower corporate charges.

Turning to slide 13. Compared to the fourth quarter, first quarter adjusted earnings decreased by about $400
million. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased due to lower prices, partially offset by higher production and lower
OpEx. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily due to favorable timing effects and lower OpEx.
On slide 14, first quarter oil-equivalent production increased over 6%. Higher shale and tight production primarily
in the Permian and higher entitlement effects were partially offset by asset sales and normal base declines.
Turning to the next slide. We're nearing completion on the asset sales program announced in 2018. In April, we
closed the sale of our interest in Azerbaijan and Colombia, resulting in almost $1.5 billion in before-tax proceeds.
This brings our total asset sales proceeds to about $6.5 billion since 2018, in the middle of our $5 billion to $10
billion guidance range.
Turning to slide 16. With cash on hand, access to the commercial paper market, and our backup revolver,
Chevron's liquidity position remains strong. We have limited long term debt maturing over the next two years. And
as a double A credit, we have ample access to the debt market.
Now looking ahead. In upstream, we're not changing our full year production guidance, although we're clarifying
that it excludes the impact of curtailments. As Mike said earlier, we expect curtailments of production during the
second quarter, in the US primarily due to economic choices that balance cash flow and long term value, and in
certain countries outside the US, mostly due to the OPEC Plus agreement.
Planned turnarounds in the second quarter, primarily at Gorgon, are expected to impact production by about
70,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. Based on our current price and capital outlook, TCO co-lending is
expected to be modestly higher this year.
In downstream, turnaround activity in the second quarter is expected to have an estimated after tax earnings
impact of $200 million to $300 million. Both equity affiliate earnings and distributions are expected to be lower in
2020 with the net negative effect to cash flow less than $1 billion.
With that, I'll turn it over to Wayne.

General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that
we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if necessary. We'll do
our best to get all of your questions answered.
Jonathan, please open the lines.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Your question, please?

General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

We're not hearing you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Oh, yes, now we can.

Philip M. Gresh

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Okay. My apologies. So first question here, just as we look at that slide where you're talking about the $30 oil
case and the funding of the dividend, the priority of the dividend, and adding debt to cover capital spending, at the
end of that period, do you have a sense of...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Phil, you cut out right when you said at the end of that period, do you have a sense of.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Yeah, Mr. Gresh, we're not hearing you right now. I'm not sure if it's your connection, your phone?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Wayne Borduin
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay, Jonathan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

I think we can move on to the next question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Okay.

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Then we can go back. And if we can clarify that we got a good connection with him.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Oh, yeah, he disconnected. All right. Our next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from
Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Devin, we're not hearing you either. Jonathan, could there be something going on in the bridge there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Wayne Borduin

A

General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, and there – as we've been discussing, there does appear to be an audio problem is what we're hearing
over the line the last few minutes, Jonathan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: What kind of audio issue are you hearing about? What is it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Devin J. McDermott

Q

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Can you hear me now?
[indiscernible] (15:35)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Yeah, we can hear you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Devin J. McDermott

Q

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

All right. Yes. Okay. I wasn't on mute, but it seems like it wasn't going through. But if you can hear me now,
maybe I'll try to pick up where I think Phil left off on the stress test for $30 Brent.
When we think about where this stress test takes you from a leverage standpoint or debt-to-capital standpoint
over that two year period, can you talk a little bit about where you'd end up at the end of 2021? And also where
you would be comfortable in terms of taking leverage to and at what...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, I think we got the essence of it, which is where do you end up at the end of 2021? And how comfortable are
you there? Pierre, why don't you respond to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, so thanks for the question. Look the chart on the left, we – gives an indication of the negative cash flow that
we expect under a stress test at $30 Brent. And then the chart on the right shows our debt position relative to
peers and relative to the zero line, which is a net debt ratio of 25%.

And when you put the two together, where the negative cash flow or that incremental debt, it keeps us – we're still
to the right of that zero line. So in other words, we can have two years at $30 Brent, invest in the business,
sustain our dividend, and still exit at the end of 2021 with a net debt ratio less than 25%, which we think is still a
very strong balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, I might just add, Devin, we're protecting the dividend, because we're set up to do so. And we've made it a
priority.
As Pierre said, we enter with a balance sheet strength that is second to none, an advantaged portfolio with a low
breakeven, capital discipline that's part of our DNA. We've demonstrated it through the way we've managed
capital spending, our discipline on transactions. And we've got capital flexibility.
And all of this is because we're committed to the dividend. And you can see that while we do lean on the balance
sheet to fund the capital program over this period of time, we can support the dividend comfortably and still
remain in a very healthy position. And we've set ourselves up to do so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Wayne Borduin

A

General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Devin. Did you have a follow-up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Devin J. McDermott

Q

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Yes. So a follow-up just on the capital spending side, building on that a little bit. So can you talk a little bit about
how you think about the trade-off between some of the near term cuts in capital spending, which really skewed
more toward short cycle, versus one of your priorities of retaining long term optionality and continue to support
longer term growth? So that preservation of long term value point.
So how do you think about that trade-off? And also, how much additional flexibility, if any, is there as you look at
the budget where it stands today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, Devin, so a few years ago, we really had a budget that was skewed towards the long term end of the
spectrum. And we've consciously shifted that now to have the short term weighting much higher within our
portfolio, because it gives us the flexibility that you talked about. And it's underpinned with the longer term
projects, but it's not dominated by those.
So we've built a more flexible portfolio that allows us to slow down the short cycle investments when the market
signal indicates that those are not being rewarded in the marketplace. And yet, we're maintaining the ability to
ramp those up. And we have longer term capital projects that are earlier in-phase. And we'll be very disciplined in
bringing those forward.
The other thing that's different that's really important is a much larger percentage of our portfolio now is facility
limited versus reservoir limited. And characterized by the kinds of declines that you can see in the different
portfolio. And that enables us to hold production with more modest capital spend and preserve the cash flow that's
associated with that.
So look, we're conscious of things like leases. We're conscious of the way we're developing our resources. But
we're trading those things off. And when the market's not calling for near term production, we shouldn't be
investing to deliver it. We should be conserving the cash for another day. And that's really how we're balancing
this out. Thanks, Devin.

Doug, we're still challenged here with this audio situation, I'm afraid. We're not hearing you. I apologize for this.
Jonathan, can we try to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Wayne Borduin

General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, Jonathan, why don't we pivot to the next question, the next in the queue?

Operator: Okay. Just one moment. Mr. Leggate, your line should be open actually at this time. Are you – hello?
Are you on mute? Okay.
Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

Neil, we've got you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta

Q

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

All right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

I'm not sure what...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta

Q

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Okay. All right. Maybe a little bit of a pause, and it works. All right. Well, thank you.
So I guess the first question was around curtailments. And can you walk us through with a little more depth about
where they are? Magnitude?
And as we think about production shut-ins, what gives us confidence that there won't be any structural damage to
the assets? And we have confidence that the supply can return when the market ultimately needs it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Sure. And so let me just frame it up a little bit, Neil. I was just talking to Devin about balancing cash flow and long
term value. And that's certainly a key driver here as we're looking at curtailments.
We are avoiding – we're trying to avoid the need for abrupt shut-ins. So these truly are, in broadly speaking,
curtailments rather than the shut-ins. With a very conscious effort to preserve reservoir and well integrity.
We do these things for turnarounds, for storms and the like, so we know how to do this quite well. And we really
don't expect any issues as we ramp back up.
Curtailments in April were relatively modest, as Pierre outlined, with the forward guidance. May and June look like
they could be more significant. About 50/50 between the US and rest of the world. And certainly in the US, the
Permian and the short cycle piece of it is the predominant part.
Around the rest of the world, it tends to be related to OPEC and OPEC Plus commitments, and the way those are
translating into local conditions. But we're very cognizant of where and how we slow production. And expect to be
able to return production when the market changes in relatively short order without putting reservoir or well
integrity at risk.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q

Good. Yeah. The follow-up
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Wayne Borduin

Thanks, Neil. Did you have a follow-up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Wayne Borduin
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Great. We see that you put a pause on the project, or at least slowed down spending. So can we get a status
check of how far you've gotten so far and how it's progressing? What the ultimate plan is around execution from
here? And any early thoughts on what that slowdown could mean for the full project budget?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. So the project is about 75% complete right now, Neil. Construction of 56 or so percent. Logistics are
working very well. As I said, there are only seven modules left in Korea. And all of those will have departed by the
end of this quarter.
We've got a number on the water, additional ones at the trans-shipment locations, and some moving through the
waterway. So the logistics are moving quite well.
Since late 2019, we've got all of the pipe racks and the gas turbine generators and utility modules on foundation.
And we continue to work on the critical path.
Locally, I mentioned we've seen COVID cases in a number of the camps. There's over 100 different residential
camps there. And as a result, we are demobilizing nonessential staff to minimize the risk of spread. That means
we're demobilizing about 17,000 people to 20 different locations. Most of these are contractors, not employees of
TCO. But we are helping to manage the logistics.
We're moving people back to other parts of Kazakhstan, Turkey, Russia, Singapore, the UK. We need to provide
contact tracing information for everybody who demobilizes. We've converted a fire station and a warehouse to a
test center. We're testing 1,500 people a day. We've got 29 nurses there, working around the clock. So a very
thoughtful effort on how we demobilize.
The people that are remaining are working in essence under a pod strategy, where workforce is isolated by shift
and by crew. We've got boxed meals, digital permits, we've got dedicated drivers and cleaners and things to really
reduce the risk. Employees are all outfitted in proper PPE and the like.
We actually are maintaining pretty good schedule progress on the critical path, in spite of all of this, which allows
us to focus the workforce on critical path and to demobilize some of the noncritical path activity.
Our power and control work, the gathering system, the sour gas injection system are all several months ahead of
the critical path. And that enables us to slow down and mitigate some of these risks.
The biggest challenges are in the area of crew changes. So we have people working on some extended rotations,
transit in and out. And the labyrinth of travel restrictions at each level, cities, countries, et cetera, is something
we're managing aggressively and carefully. We're testing people as they arrive to minimize quarantine on arrival.
So a very focused and thus far I would say a very successful effort to respond to this. The main focus is on the
pressure boost facility in the utilities and the processing plant, which are on the critical path.
In terms of the actual reduction in C&E, our share, about $1 billion, about half of that is deferral of activity. About a
third of that is mitigation of cost growth through aggressive creative measures. And the balance is really related to
foreign exchange.
So hopefully that gives you a sense of where we are. And certainly as we go forward on every call, we'll know
more. We'll see how things have unfolded there. And we will provide you additional information as we have it.

Jeanine Wai

Q

Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

So my first question, now that you can hear me, is on sustaining CapEx. And we know, Mike, that you don't really
talk about sustaining CapEx on a one year basis at all. But can you comment on whether the new $12 billion
annualized CapEx run rate is enough to maintain what you would consider an acceptable reserve replacement
ratio over a longer term period?
And whether this can also allow you to achieve your corporate objectives of increasing ROCE, shareholder
returns, and all of that? But maybe at a different rate from what you thought before?

Yeah, Jeanine, you are correct. This really isn't a way that we think about the business. It's not something we rely
on or plan around to measure the business. So it's not a simple question to answer, because it's just not how we
think about things. We do understand it's a question among some in the investment community.
Pierre has been thinking about how to try to help you guys understand this a little bit better and translate from how
we run the business to how these questions come in. So, Pierre, maybe you can help Jeanine with that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, thanks, Jeanine. And as Mike says, we don't think about the business this way. And to the earlier question,
we're not sustaining short term production, right? That's a very deliberate choice. Mike talked about that. The
price signal says we don't need short term production. And we're prioritizing capital on long term value.
So again, if sustaining short term production is part of the definition, then it's just not how we manage the
business, as we're trying to balance the short term and the long term.
But if we think of sustaining capital as kind of an analytical construct, that's really the capital to keep upstream
production capacity flat from existing fields for a number of years. And so in that definition, I'd exclude exploration,
I'd exclude capital to develop new fields or for expansions like in Tengiz. I'd exclude assets that are sold or
contracts that are going to expire. And I'd exclude downstream and chemicals.
And so if you go through that, and you know we talk about $11 billion for our upstream base business, and shale
and tight total capital, and that results in some growth, about $10 billion would be a reasonable estimate of the
capital to keep that production capacity flat from existing fields for a number of years.
Again, we're below that right now, right? We started with base and shale and tight at $11 billion. If you roll through
the reductions, we'll be under $8 billion. So again short term production, we do not expect to be sustained at your
kind of notional $12 billion capital, which includes downstream and chemicals with some cuts in exploration. But
long term value is preserved. Thanks, Jeanine.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.

Q

All right. Perfect. All right. Thank you. I think that it seems that potentially that we were cut off, so I will ask both
questions first.
I think the first one, my – in a – not that you will have a target now, but that the sector is being compressed and a
lot of your peers is under distress. If there's a right deal, how much is the balance sheet you're willing to risk in
this kind of environment for the right deal at all?
And the second question, maybe – may as well that – ask that just in case I get cut off. This is for Pierre. You
have a strong balance sheet. But it look like you're going to have a substantial cash burn for this year and next
year under a pretty depressed pricing environment that we see.
You raised some debt. Does it make sense for you, given the debt market is actually open, and the cost is quite
low for you at this point, to raise even more debt to pre-fund the potential cash burn? Or that you think the
commercial market is really available and you don't need to do that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. Yeah, Paul, you're an experienced multi-part questioner, so I think that was good to get both of those in.
Let me give you a quick response. And then Pierre I'm sure will have some thoughts he'd like to add there.
The reason we showed this low price stress test, Paul, was to give you a sense that we really can endure a
couple of years of really tough pricing. And our gearing would move back to a level that is not an uncomfortable
level to be at. In fact, Pierre has said frequently that over time, we would anticipate moving our gearing back into
the kind of 20% to 25% range anyway.
Now this isn't necessarily the way we thought we would get there. But that's not an uncomfortable place for us to
be.
So leaning on the balance sheet through this period of time is something that's very doable. And we'll maintain a
strong credit rating as we do that. And so we're certainly willing to go there. And as you know, in years gone by,
and you go back a few years ago, our gearing was above that 25%. And so I think we're in a range that we've
demonstrated we can manage and we know how to.
In terms of going to debt markets at low cost, I do think that it's prudent to look at that. And debt is attractively
priced right now. And it wouldn't be surprising for us to look to add to that. So, Pierre, maybe you can comment on
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, I think there was an M&A question too there about using our balance sheet for M&A. But I think I can just
address, you can also use equity as part of a transaction. So we don't view the balance sheet as the only means
to do M&A, because equity makes sense in an oil deal, where there's price risk and obviously price volatility. And
you wouldn't want a winner and loser between the buyer and the seller on an M&A deal.
In terms of, I think Mike addressed the debt question. I mean, yeah, as we consume cash, we will lengthen out
the maturities. We'll look at when there's a good window to approach the bond markets.
We do have access to a lot of commercial paper. That was shown on the liquidity side. Commercial paper still
remains the lowest cost and the most flexible source of funding for us. But under these kinds of conditions, and if
the conditions persist, we would want to have some more longer term debt. That would be appropriate. And I think
as Mike said, you shouldn't be surprised if you see us approach the market.

Paul Sankey

Q

Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC

Oh, my God, sorry about that. The question is, how has the world changed for you post this thing? Obviously, we
can see the future strip is pressured for 2021. And I think you've addressed that a little bit. I think it's clear that
your mega projects, Australia, Kazakhstan, sort of continue as they were and ultimately have very low breakevens
when they're running.
I guess the question would be, firstly, on the Gulf of Mexico, is the world do you think different there? And most
importantly obviously for your company? We know that you wanted to buy Anadarko for the acreage in the
Permian. How do you think that the world has changed as regards to the Permian, given what's happened? Thank
you, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Okay. Thank you, Paul. Well, I think when you're in the depth of something as unprecedented as this, it's hard to
say exactly how the world will change on the other side of it. And as much as it feels like this has been going on
for a long time, we're really just a couple of months into it.
And so I think on the other side of it, I'm an optimist. I have great confidence with all the resources being
dedicated to vaccine development and therapeutics and testing capacity. I'm an optimist that in time, the health
risks will be successfully mitigated and managed.
I believe that the world will return to some post-coronavirus form of normal. And that means economic activity, it
means growth, it means travel.
The pace and the patterns at which that reemerges I think are still open to a wide range of views. And I don't
know that anybody can predict that exactly.
But when you translate that back to our industry, I think it plays into some things that we have long believed,
which is low cost of supply matters. Operational excellence and discipline in project execution matters. Capital
discipline matters. Cost discipline matters. And all those things will become very apparent as we recover in some
form with inventory length in the market, with OPEC production off, and with the opportunity for shale and tight to
come back in relatively rapidly.
And so I think the term lower-for-longer has been used for a while to describe conditions. I think that is even more
appropriate today than it has been in past times when it's been used. I think we need to be very focused on
efficient use of every one of our resources to operate well and to drive the cost of supply down in a world that
looks like it'll be pretty well supplied.
So you get to the Gulf of Mexico. And the Gulf of Mexico has been resetting its cost structure to compete in a
world like this. I think it means we've got more work to do to make the Gulf of Mexico compete even more. More
focus on tie-backs, in-fill drilling, utilizing existing infrastructure, and finding efficient ways to develop in the Gulf of
Mexico. And so that trend is one that we need to stay on. We've made a lot of progress. And I think there's more
work to be done there.
In the Permian, our – we're not done improving in the Permian. Our results, even as we sit here today, continue to
improve. And so well costs come down, drilling efficiency improves, completion design and execution improves,
and the hydrocarbons haven't gone away. The rocks don't go bankrupt. Companies might, but the rocks won't.
And I think that that's a resource that will continue to be very important in the overall supply picture. And certainly
it will be for our company.
And so we'll look to invest in the very best projects. We'll look to acquire assets and opportunities, be they through
exploration or other means, that will compete in our portfolio and continue to be attractive in a world where low
cost of supply and the ability to generate good returns matters.
So in some ways those fundamentals are only more important going forward than they have been, Paul. And
beyond that, I think it's speculation on a lot of the other things you hear people talk about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Wayne Borduin
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks, Paul. Okay. So we're going to pull an audible here. I've actually got Doug Leggate's questions keyed up.
He had trouble dialing back in, so he texted me his questions, Mike, and I'm going to feed them to you that way.
So the first one was for Mike. Shell thinks the whole industry needs a reset, a change in long term supply, et
cetera. They just cut the dividend to adapt. What do you think of the big picture at this point? And then the second
one will be for Pierre.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay, look, I think everybody is – it's interesting, Doug, and apologies we couldn't get you on the phone directly
here. I wish we could have the conversation directly.
I think we've actually seen more of a divergence in strategies and thinking among companies in our industry over
the last few years than we have in a long time. And everybody has got a slightly different take on where they're
going and where their strengths are. And so I can't speak for another company. I will just tell you it's very similar
to what I was saying in response to Paul Sankey's question.
I think the companies that can be reliable, efficient, low cost providers will continue to have a very strong position
as leaders in our industry. And the world is not ready to transition to another source of energy in large part any
time soon. And so the resumption of economic growth will require the sources of energy that we know today and
that fuel the world today. And there will be a need for what we do.
And I think you have to be very honest with yourself about where you're good and where you're not. And you've
got to focus on improving and closing gaps where you need to improve and getting even better where you have
strengths.
So again it kind of gets back to the fundamentals. Capital discipline, cost discipline, project execution, and the
ability – and I'll say it if we haven't said it clearly enough, your balance sheet is a great asset. And often times we
think of our upstream or downstream assets as the most important assets. And they're very, very important in our
business.
The balance sheet is also a very important asset. You have to treat it with a priority. You have to be prepared for
the day when you need to rely on that asset. And I think that also becomes very, very important as we move
forward.
We've been prudent in the way we've managed that. We were positioned differently than others as we went into
this. And I think you can see, as I said, while we wouldn't have predicted this exact market scenario, we were
prepared for an environment like this. And we will navigate our way through it with our shareholders in mind.
Second question for Pierre?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Wayne Borduin

A

General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, second question is around cash CapEx. Of the $14 billion guide, how much of that cash CapEx? And how
much further can that go down without impeding cash flow and production?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, so again, sorry, Doug, we couldn't get you on. So about $9.3 billion is the cash CapEx equivalent to $14
billion. So it was $10.5 billion at $16 billion, so it went down. $1.2 billion of the $2 billion additional reduction is in
cash capital.
I think Mike has addressed it, I addressed it with sustaining CapEx. Again, at the CapEx levels and to Jeanine's
question, when we're at $12 billion, when you back out reduced downstream and exploration, we are below the
level to sustain short term production. And again, that's a deliberate decision, because there's not a lot of value in
putting capital that results in production at current prices.
We are investing. And I should have said to Jeanine's answer, although we're below the $10 billion let's call it
sustaining capital on base and shale and tight, which will cause some decline, we are investing in TCO FGPWPMP, which will come on in 2022 and 2023 and provide that kind of long term value.
So again, the choices that Mike and the leadership team are making are really balancing the short term and the
long term and being thoughtful about where the capital reductions are and where the capital investments are.

Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of (sic) Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.
Your question, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pavel Molchanov
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Q

Thanks for taking the question. Along the lines of what you said about the energy transition not being as realistic
perhaps as what a lot of folks are saying, your CO2 targets assumed a pre-COVID production rate. Given that
across the board volumes will be coming down, are you looking to upsize those decarbonization targets that you
put out last summer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Pavel, it's interesting. Everybody in the industry has defined their targets just a little bit differently. And we
haven't actually put out absolute targets, which you would expect absolute greenhouse gas emissions to come
down if people are restricting activity.
We put out intensity targets. So greenhouse gas emissions per unit of production, we got a target for per barrel of
oil in the upstream. We got a target per – for gas production. And then we've got flaring and methane emission
targets, all of which are unit targets that drive down unit emissions.
And so we have not reset those. We would expect that we will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,
irrespective of COVID or any of these other circumstances. These are commitments we've made. We've tied
peoples' compensation to them. And we intend to continue to reduce our emissions footprint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

And just the other add. The other distinction is that we've done it on an equity basis, so whether we operate or
don't operate, our whole – all the barrels or all the MCFs are in those intensity metrics that Mike talked about, not
just our operated barrels.

Q

Okay. Quick question about LNG, if I may. Is there any change in the historical linkage between Asian LNG prices
and Brent crude, given what's happened in the last 60 days?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Pavel, the contracts have not changed. And of course, we sell most of our volume on contract. Our contracts
typically are linked to – not linked to Brent directly, but linked to JCC, or Japanese Crude Cocktail. Another one
that's linked to a JKM index, which is a gas related index.
So I think commodity prices have some sympathetic relationship with one another. But they're not always
perfectly correlated. And so I think you would certainly say that our crude linked contracts will reflect crude prices.
And to the extent Brent has come off, eventually our crude linked contracts will reflect that. They tend to be on a
lagged basis. And so they don't always reflect current month pricing. But broadly speaking, yes, you'll see a
connection between those two.

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Hey, Doug.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Terreson
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC

Q

Mike, you guys were an early and a power adopter of the disciplined capital management model. And that has
obviously served your shareholders well during the upturn and now the downturn too. So first, kudos to you guys
for that.
And then to the points about industry stress that I think Paul and Paul brought up earlier, which often lead to
consolidation, my question is that, while financial benefits are often available on a variety of transactions, strategic
benefits on the scale that you guys receive from Gulf and Texaco and Unocal back in the day may or may not be
this time around.
And so I wanted to see if you'd frame the strategic condition today. How you think it's similar or different from prior
downturns, given your history? And also any other notable color or philosophy that you want to share on this
topic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah so I guess if you go back all the way to Gulf, and that takes you back to the 1980s, the industry was highly
fragmented, even amongst the largest players. And so there were as you say financial benefits of consolidation.
And there were strategic benefits, as you brought together portfolios that had gaps in them. And we certainly saw
that with Gulf. We saw it again with Texaco.
I think today we've got fewer large players. And so the impact of any single transaction that is not amongst large
players – and those are pretty hard to do as you get down to small numbers – they're less profound, both from a
financial standpoint, simply because you don't have the same scale that you're consolidating. And it flows through
to the asset portfolios.

And so the players that, like ourselves and our big peers, have exposure to many basins around the world to all
the segments of the value chain. And I think everybody has worked to try to optimize their portfolios in a way that
they think fits with their strategy.
And so I think your point is a good one. You can do kind of rifle shots that would be maybe smaller, both on the
financial and the strategic dimension, that could fill in nicely. But things that would be transformative the way we
saw back around the 1999-2000 period, I think you're right. I think that's a lot harder to envision today.
And everybody has become more efficient, and so even the synergies that we saw back then, technology was
different, information technology was different, productivity was different. And so I think competition has made
everybody sharper and more efficient, and so those financial synergies are harder to capture.

questions.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Biraj Borkhataria
Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.

QOh, perfect. Awesome. So I'll get out my two questions, just in case. But the first one is on the Permian and your
shut-in [ph] room (54:16) economics there. I guess you mentioned that 50% of the curtailment is in the US. And
then most of that is the Permian. I was wondering if you could talk about the process on how you got to the
number you're looking to curtail? And why that is the appropriate number for the environment that you see? That
would be the first question.
And then the second question is on your CapEx reduction. Obviously, part of this is economics, but there's
another element which is not necessarily choice. So you mentioned slowing down in the Tengiz.
I was wondering if there's an element of the CapEx, or if you could quantify the element of CapEx that is simply
CapEx that you couldn't spend even if you wanted to for logistical reasons or otherwise. Just trying to get a sense
of that would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, okay. Well, on Permian curtailment, as we've said, we've pulled capital down significantly. So we're not
putting capital in to bring new production online.
And as you look at the flowing production, not every barrel is created equally. We've got some older vertical wells,
for instance, that in this kind of an environment have pretty marginal economics. We would look at those.
We've got barrels that have a different oil/gas ratio. We would look at that. We look at net-backs, logistics, and
value chain, cash flow, storage cost, future prices, a whole host of things. And then as I mentioned earlier, the
desire to avoid future need for abrupt shut-ins if we were to see logistics and flow curtailed.
So there are a series of things that we've got a team looking at across the entire basin and factoring into decisions
that we think are prudent decisions from a value standpoint and an operating standpoint.
And it's a moving target. We actually, this is something that our senior leadership team is involved in multiple
times a week. And so the models to do this, to understand markets, and to stay really in touch with markets, to be
sure we're making good decisions, continue to be informed by new information. And so it's a very dynamic
process that we're engaged in right now.
On the capital side, on the kind of non-discretionary, non-our choice capital, Pierre, can you take that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, I think the vast majority are decisions and choices we're making. But it gets into how you define it. For
example, in Tengiz, we're choosing to demob the noncritical path project personnel. But clearly that is COVID
related. So I don't know if you call that a choice.
We have a crisis management team that is overseeing supply chains and the whole system. But the bottom line is
the vast majority are decisions that we are making, in some cases, with partners. We're seeing in almost all
cases, partners are very aligned on actions that we're taking.
Now we do have some currency effects, right? So the dollar is stronger, so there is part of the capital reduction.
It's also very modest. That's a reflection of currency effects.


But I would look at the vast majority of the 30% reduction as being choices that we're making to flex capital, pace
capital, defer capital that is largely driven by our decisions to balance cash flow and long term value.
Thanks, Biraj.

So I'll just ask sort of a focused question. You've gone over a lot of high level stuff. But because your downstream
footprint, you have a pretty good look into Asia. Some other operators have been talking about some interesting
observations they've made about the timing disparity between Asia emerging from the COVID crisis, versus the
rest of the world. And kind of using it as maybe a soft proxy around the slope that demand might recover. Or what
that might look like on the other side of this. Could you share whatever observations or thoughts you have around
what you're seeing?

Yeah, Sam, there's a great quote from Lee Kuan Yew that Asia is a figment of the Western imagination. He said –
it was more of a cultural quote. But it's, Asia is a big area is the reason I bring that up.
And what's happening in China is different than what's happening in Indonesia right now. And what was
happening in South Korea is different than what's happening in Thailand.
And so broadly speaking, I would say Asia and other parts of the world, it would appear the demand has found a
bottom. And that we're kind of bumping along the bottom right now.
And the biggest hit has been on aviation fuels. And then you've got gasoline, which is off 50% give or take around
most of the world. Diesel, more like 25%. And so these numbers generally hold in most of the places where we're
doing business right now.
And then you have regional signals and signs that things are starting to move. China clearly has come off the
bottom. Some other markets in Asia that have seen kind of a second wave, and they've reinstituted some of these
lockdown type policies. The green shoots seem to have pulled back a little bit.
So I would say it's highly specific to the market in Asia where you are. But there are certainly signs in a number of
markets of a resumption of activity and a resumption of demand growth. And they tend to correlate pretty well with
when the policies are relaxed and people can begin to get back to work and start to move around again.
And so I think there are small positive signals. We had a meeting earlier this week where we talked about it being
not the beginning of the end, but the end of the beginning. I think it feels like we're finding the bottom right now.
And then the path up out of this is likely to be different in different regions of the world, as it ties to the health
status in those parts of the world.
But I think this quarter, and perhaps next quarter, feel like we're about in – as I said, bumping along the bottom
and going to begin to emerge out of it here at some point over that time.

Loud and clear, Ryan.

Ryan Todd

Q

Sr. Research Analyst, Simmons Energy

Great. Good morning, everybody. Maybe a couple quick ones. The $2 billion of additional CapEx cuts, on the
fuzzy chart that looks like it's coming from kind of spread across all businesses. Any additional color on where the
cuts are coming from?
And in the Permian, I think that the exit rate at the end of the year was still the same. So maybe any thoughts on
how we think of the trajectory there in the Permian? And then I have one follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, so the $2 billion, broadly you can think about a little bit less than $1 billion coming out of a major capital
project, so that's primarily TCO. So we'd already factored in a little bit of reduction in TCO in the first reduction
down to $16 billion. But not nearly as much as we're seeing now. So call it $800 million or so on major capital
projects.
About $500 million each on unconventionals and on other base business. And the unconventionals would include
not only Permian but also Argentina, Canada. And then about another $200 million coming out of downstream
and chemicals. So I think if you take those and rack them up, that gets you to the $2 billion.
On the Permian, our guidance still is that we'll exit the year at roughly the level that we came in, or 125,000
barrels lower than what we had initially indicated, if you were to look at the chart we used at the Investor Day
meeting.
And notwithstanding the fact that we're seeing some curtailments there, and we're pulling back on the rigs, the
momentum coming into the year has been strong. And Permian production growth in the first quarter, which
largely reflects wells that were put on production last year. And we had more POPs in the second half of the year
than we did in the first half of the year. First quarter Permian production was strong.
And so that'll peak out here over the middle part of the year and come back off as the effects of the capital
reductions and the curtailments are – roll through the system. But our expectation is that we'll exit roughly where
we entered, which is about 125,000 less than the numbers we showed you in early March.

You hung in. If you've hung in here, you get a follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan Todd
Sr. Research Analyst, Simmons Energy

Q

Great. Maybe one. I know there's a huge amount of uncertainty right now, as is clear. But maybe thoughts on
implications as we think of the recovery coming out of this. In a very specific sense, on curtailments, what's the
signal? Is it clearly – is it just a netback price that will drive the resumption of those volumes, at least on the ones
that you operate and control?
And then as we think about the budget, as we move out of the current level of spend, and you start to work your
way back towards maybe the $20 billion level that we were in before, I mean how do you – what are the sort of
signals that you see that'll I guess first to allow you to turn on curtailed volumes? And then allow you to put rigs
back to work in the Permian?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, so on the first one on curtailments, I would say they're going to be market signals around the economic
value of those barrels. And netbacks will be an important part of that.
We will also, because we can pull some of these things through the value chain into markets, we can – what
export markets look like. What are – we've got a refinery that we pull some of our Permian production into. So
refining margins and the value chain opportunities will play into our thinking there as well.
So we look at these things across the entire value chain. But it'll be an economic signal that says these barrels
are being called for by the market. And the contribution is more positive.
In terms of the capital spending, those are longer cycle decisions than curtailments. And I think you can expect us
to be thoughtful and not rush capital back into the market prematurely. But it'll be our view on where markets are
headed.

So curtailments is kind of more or less where markets are or where they're likely to be in the relative short term.
Capital spending is going to be more of a medium term kind of a view. And it's because this flexible asset class,
we don't need to really look at the long term signal. I mean we always factor that in.
But the medium term, given the production profile on each individual unconventional well, we'll be looking at
signals that suggest that that's strengthening. And that the demand is there. And you're going to watch OPEC.
You're going to watch inventories. There's a whole series of indicators I think that will help us inform decision
making there.
