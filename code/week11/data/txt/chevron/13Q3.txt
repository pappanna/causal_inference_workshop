Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome toChevron's third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, therewill be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As areminder, this conference call is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference call over to V ice President and Chief Financial Officer of ChevronCorporation, Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.Great, thank you, Jonathan.Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and Webcast. On the call with me today are JoeGeagea, Corporate Vice President and President Gas & Midstream; and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager,Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and otherforward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2.Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $5 billionor $2.57 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 15%. Our debt ratio at theend of September was 11%. In the third quarter we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In t he fourth quarterwe expect to repurchase the same amount. Though not shown on the slide, I'd like to call attention to our trackrecord on shareholder return. We're in first place on total shareholder return for the 3 -year, 5-year and 10-yearperiods compared to our peer group of global integrated energy companies.Turning to slide 4, cash generated from operations was $10 billion during the third quarter and approximately$25 billion year-to-date. The third quarter was the strongest cash generation quarter this year. Adverse workingcapital effects noted earlier in the year continued to abate. Importantly, third quarter also saw stronger operatingperformance in both our upstream and downstream businesses.Capital and Exploratory [C&E] expenditures were $9.6 billion during the quarter and $26.4 billion year -to-date.I'd like to make it clear that major resource acquisitions stemming from our business development activities arenot included in our annual budget targets. We have found the success rate, timing and pricing for this effort to betoo uncertain to effectively include in our annual budgeting and Board approval process for C&E. Because we'vebeen very successful this year in our resource acquisition effort, picking up acreage and project opportunities inCanada, Australia, and the Kurdistan region of Iraq, we anticipate we will close the year with C&E outlays aboveour planned level. While there are still some large uncertainties on timing, we presently anticipate our 2013 C&Einvestments will be around 10% or so higher than our original target for the year.At quarter end, our cash balances exceeded $18 billion. As total debt balances were identical in size, we ended thequarter in a neutral net cash, net debt position. Confirming what I have said previously, the company continues tomove toward a more traditional net debt structure.Jeff will now take us through the quarterly comparisons. Jeff?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.Thanks, Pat.Turning to slide 5, I'll compare results of the third quarter 2013 with the second quarter of 2013. As a reminder,our earnings release compares third quarter 2013 with the same quarter a year ago.Third quarter earnings were $5 billion, about $400 million lower than second quarter results. Foreign exchangemovements accounted for more than the overall decrease in earnings, worth almost $600 million of the decline.The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the second quarter and the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the third qua rtercaused the significant swing between the two periods. We moved from a net positive foreign exchange position inthe second quarter of $300 million to a net negative position of nearly the same amount in the third quarter.Without this element, our earnings performance this quarter would actually be better than the prior quarter.Upstream earnings were up $143 million, reflecting higher liquids realizations and liftings, mostly offset byunfavorable foreign exchange effects. Downstream results decrease d $386 million between quarters. Lowermargins and unfavorable foreign exchange effects, partly offset by higher volumes, drove the decrease. Thevariance in the Other bar largely reflects an unfavorable swing in corporate tax items during the quarter.On slide 6, our U.S. upstream earnings for the third quarter were $57 million lower than second quarter's results.Higher realizations increased earnings by $90 million, driven largely by a rise in crude oil prices, partially offsetby the fall in natural gas prices. Lower production volumes decreased earnings by $30 million, mainly due tomaintenance activity in the Gulf of Mexico, partly offset by higher production in the Permian. The Other barreflects a number of unrelated items, including higher DD&A and higher exploration expenses.Turning to slide 7 , international upstream earnings were $200 million higher than the second quarter. Higherrealizations increased earnings by $430 million. Average liquids unit realizations increased by 11%, consistentwith the increase in average Brent spot prices between quarters. The timing of liftings across multiple countriesincreased earnings by $90 million. At the end of the quarter, we were in a slightly over -lifted position.An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $465 million. The third quarter had a lossof about $190 million compared to a gain of about $27 5 million in the second quarter. The Other bar reflects anumber of items: favorable tax effects, gains on asset transactions, and lower operating expenses were partiallyoffset by higher exploration expenses.Slide 8 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Productionincreased 3,000 barrels per day between quarters. New wells at our Agbami and Usan projects in Nigeria,additional production from the Delaware Basin in the Permian, as well as volumes associated with Angola LNG,increased net production by about 22,000 barrels per day. Planned maintenance activities decreased productionby 14,000 barrels per day during the quarter, most notably in the U.K., Trinidad and Thailand, with a partialoffset from less maintenance activity in Australia.External constraints hurt third quarter production by 10,000 barrels per day, primarily due to a mid-quarterlightning strike in Thailand, which severely damaged and necessitated the shutdown of a customer's gasprocessing plant. This in turn curtailed our Thai gas production. The Base Business and Other bar includes theimpact of normal field declines, cost recoveries, and the impact of price effects on entitlement volumes.Production for the first three quarters of 2013 averaged just over 2.6 million barrels a day below our initial fullyear-production guidance of 2.65 million barrels per day. Several factors have affected our year -to-dateproduction results. First, Angola LNG's ramp-up of production has been slower than anticipated. Second, turnaroundactivity across various locations has been more expensive than originally planned. A final contributingfactor relates to the damage at the gas plant in Thailand.We expect volumes to be higher in the fourth quarter as production is restored following maintenance -relateddown time during the third quarter and as new production comes online. For the full year, we expect to come inaround 98% to 99% of our original production target.Turning to slide 9, U.S. downstream earnings improved by $111 million between periods. Higher volumesincreased earnings by $55 million primarily due to our Richmond, California, refinery running at normal capacityfor the full quarter. Lower refining and marketing margins decreased earnings by $95 million driven by risingcrude costs. Reduced industry crack spreads also reflected improved supply conditions and higher plantutilization rates following the end of second quarter maintenance activity.Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $30 million primarily due to lower environmental charges.Greater gains on miscellaneous small asset sales improved earnings in t he third quarter by $60 million. Thechemicals and other variance primarily reflects the absence of planned and unplanned down time at CPChem'sPort Arthur and Sweeny plants in the second quarter.On slide 10, international downstream earnings increased by $497 million between quarters – decreased by $497million between quarters. Higher plant utilization rates boosted volumes and increased earnings by $30 million inthe third quarter. Refining and marketing margins were lower by $220 million. Rising crude costs, continued softproduct demand and oversupply in the Far East weakened industry crack spreads while price lag effects mainly forjet fuel and naphtha in Asia impacted marketing margins.Timing effects represented a $140 million negative earnings variance between quarters driven largely by therevaluation of inventory. The swing between quarters was primarily due to rising crude prices during the thirdquarter compared to falling crude prices during the second quarter.Foreign currency swings reduced earnings by about $115 million. Third quarter had a loss of approximately $85million compared to a small gain of $30 million in the second quarter. The Other bar includes a number ofunrelated items including various tax items and higher shipping costs.Slide 11 covers All Other. Third quarter net charges were $522 million compared to $350 million in the secondquarter, an increase of $17 2 million between periods. Adverse corporate tax items resulted in a $219 milliondecrease to earnings between quarters. Our overall year-to-date effective tax rate at just around 40% is trending alittle lower than in recent years. As you know, in any one period this overall rate can be influenced by many factorsincluding jurisdictional mix between upstream and downstream, jurisdictional mix within upstream, foreignexchange and asset sales transactions. Corporate charges and other items were $47 million lower this quarter.Year-to-date net charges in the All Other segment were $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. We believe ourquarterly guidance range of $400 to $500 million for the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward.Joe is now going to provide update on our LNG marketing activities. Joe?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp.Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about the LNG market and our LNG portfolio. So turning to slide 13, I'llstart by grounding you quickly on the global demand outlook for energy.The world economy is growing, driving increased demand for all forms of energy. Much of this growth is in Asiawhere people increasingly aspire for a better quality of life and achieving this aspiration does require stable,secure and affordable energy supplies.Total world energy demand is forecast to increase 30% by 2025 from today's level. Natural gas demand isprojected to grow even more by about 40% by 2025 and LNG demand growth is expected to be even greater.Turning to slide 14, LNG demand has already doubled since 2000 and it is predicted to double again by 2025.Meeting this demand would require three elements: maintaining the reliability of existing supply, deliveringcurrent LNG projects under construction and investing in the construction of new LNG capacity. Even if the firsttwo elements are well in hand this still leaves an opportunity of around 150 million tons per year of new projectsto be sanctioned.Now many buyers are counting on the United States to make up the shortfall with pricing linked to Henry Hub.Even if you believe the most predictions of new U.S. supply available for export there is still a projected shortfall ofmore than 50 million tons in 2025. And more reasonable predictions of U.S. exports suggest a gap of around 100million tons in 2025. So the U.S. alone will not bridge this forecasted supply demand gap and thus we believe newsupply needs to come from multiple sources.Now developing these supplies will also take time whether that's for permitting and construction of U.S. LNGexport terminals or for exploration, appraisal and development of new producing regions such as East Africa.Building and maintaining LNG facilities is technically challenging, capital intensive and requires significantexpertise. The last 35 LNG projects developed globally, took on average over 18 years to deliver that LNG tomarket although we do acknowledge that completion times are improving.Additionally, capacity utilization rates for LNG facilities in production have only averaged about 85% in recentyears. Geopolitical instability, resource availability and unplanned turnarounds have resulted on average inroughly 35 million metric tons of the existing nameplate capacity being unavailable at any given time.Turning to slide 15, while we have seen growth in global LNG trading and expect that interregional trade of LNGwill continue to increase, we believe that global gas markets will remain regionally distinct over the medium tolong-term. This is mainly due to the high cost and relative lack of infrastructure to transport and store gasglobally. While two-thirds of the world's oil is shipped by tanker, only 10% of the world's current natural gassupply is shipped as LNG. This is forecast to increase to 14% by 2025. We believe the majority of thi s LNG willcontinue to be delivered under long-term contracts.The traditional LNG importing countries of Japan, Korea and Taiwan have no interconnecting pipelineinfrastructure and virtually no indigenous energy resources and therefore rely on LNG to mee t almost all of theirgas demand. Only five years ago 17 countries were importing LNG. Today, 26 countries are doing so and this isexpected to increase.So let's move to slide 16 where I'd like to focus more specifically on U.S. LNG exports. Many analyst forecast thatU.S. LNG exports should reach approximately 50 million tons per year by 2025 equivalent to around 11% of theworld's LNG demand and about 8% of domestic U.S. gas demand. At these levels, U.S. LNG exports would onlyrepresent a small share of the global LNG market. Greenfield LNG projects are unlikely to be developed outside ofthe United States unless a significant portion of the off take is committed under long -term contracts with robustpricing that underpins the financial investment requir ed to monetize these resources.A common perception is that Henry Hub link pricing will mean landed LNG prices in Asia will be significantly lessthan other world sources. We think that's not automatically a given. U.S. liquifaction costs are likely to ri se asmore projects compete for resources including engineering contractors, fabrication yard space and projectfinancing.In addition, growing demand in the United States for new petrochemical projects, power plants, exports to Mexicoand the transportation segment will mean new demand pull on the same supply base. Coupled with weather andstorage effects this could easily lead to increased price strength and volatility for Henry Hub.In order to ensure that sufficient supplies do get developed there nee ds to be cooperation, alignment andunderstanding between LNG buyers and suppliers. This is helped when buyers diversify their energy mix;maintain a geographically diverse LNG portfolio, recognizing that no one region, including the United States, canmeet all expected demand and finally, take equity positions in LNG projects to ensure the right projects are builtin the right places for the right price. Now we've seen this formula work in Gorgon and Wheatstone and we'reconfident the same will be true for Kitimat.Turning to slide 17, I'd like to now talk about our LNG sale commitments. From a portfolio perspective we believeit's prudent to leave around 25% of volume for placement on the spot market for operational flexibility. However,at the individual project level this ratio may vary. For example, on Gorgon we are 65% committed. We are stillprepared to increase volumes under contract, however, Gorgon is scheduled to come online at a time when limitednew supplies are expected, so we are confident of being able to place uncommitted volumes into the market.On Wheatstone, 85% of Chevron's equity LNG is now committed on long-term basis. In addition to the Gorgonand Wheatstone foundation projects we have made good progress this year with buyers for LNG from ourIndonesia Deepwater Development or IDD. For our unsanctioned projects including IDD, Kitimat and GorgonTrain 4, we are targeting to have around 70% committed under long-term contracts by the time we reach a finalinvestment decision. Once achieved we will end up with our desired portfolio objective of having 7 5% of our LNGprojection sold through long-term contracts.Turning to slide 18, I'd like to close by showing you how Chevron is well positioned to become a major LNGsupplier by the end of this decade based on Wood Mack [Wood Mackenzie] estimates. With the projects underconstruction at Gorgon and Wheatstone and with our existing equity shares in Angola LNG and AustraliaNorthwest Shelf we will be one of top 10 LNG suppliers in the world. If we include Kitimat and Gorgon Train 4 wewill potentially move into the top five.In summary, we see strong LNG market fundamentals supporting our growing LNG portfolio, which should allowus to deliver strong future gas generation for many years to come.I will now turn it back to Pat.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.Okay. Thank you, Joe.Now let's take a look at the latest updates on our LNG projects. The Gorgon project is over 7 0% complete. Wecontinue to make good progress on all fronts. In early October we installed the third of five gas turbine generators.To date, 14 of the 21 LNG Train 1 process modules have been installed, three are in transit and the remaining arescheduled to follow in fairly rapid succession. Work on the jetty is progressing. We now have 43 of the 56 jettycaissons installed, including those needed to support all key structural elements.We have recently reached the mechanical completion of the domestic gas pipeline in preparat ion for operationalreadiness by year end. Offshore pipelines are complete on the IO/Jansz 30 -inch pipeline. And finally, three wellsat the IO/Jansz field are ready to flow gas and seven wells are completed at the Gorgon field.Wheatstone is preceding per plan, and is now over 20% complete. We continue to transform the site with ongoingearth work and good progress on establishing critical infrastructure. Construction continues on the materials off -loading facility and we completed our first permanent foundation concrete pour in September. Site preparationcontinues with about 19% of 23,000 piles driven including the commencement of the LNG tank pile driving.Platform construction is over 43% complete and we have received critical platform equipment such a s the powertransformers and process vessels. We just completed our micro-tunnel boring under the shoreline in preparationfor the offshore installation of the trunk line. Now we've posted several updated photos of progress made at bothGorgon and Wheatstone on our investor website located at chevron.com I invite you to take a look at those.For Kitimat, front-end engineering continues on plan. We remain focused on early earthworks at the LNG plantsite where construction on the office, camp industrial site and service road is ongoing. Key activities for the PacificTrail Pipeline are obtaining necessary permits, building roads and securing right -of-way access. LNG marketingactivities and engagement with potential foundation customers are underway. The timing of the final investmentdecision will be determined by our ability to secure sufficient LNG off-take agreements with our customers.Turning now to slide 20. I'd like to share some highlights of the strategic progress we've made during the quarter.We signed binding long-term sales and purchase agreements with the Tohoku Electric Power Company in Japanto supply just under 1 million tons per year of LNG for up to 20 years. As Joe noted, this brings total volumescommitted to customers in Asia on a long-term basis to 85% for our Wheatstone project.Continuing with the Australian theme, we recently announced the acquisition of two deepwater explorationinterests located in the Bight Basin off the southern Australian coast. These are very large blocks with significantexploration potential and further reinforces the importance of Australia to Chevron's global growth strategy.In Canada, we successfully completed an initial 12 well exploration dwelling program in the liquids rich portion ofKaybob area of the Duvernay shale play. Initial well results were very encouraging with average initial productionrates in excess of 1,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Both of these developments are consistent with our focuson early entry opportunities, which have the potential to generate the most value for our shareholders.We also had a major milestone in our downstream and chemicals business. CPChem announced final investmentdecisions for its U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project. This project includes const ruction of a 1.5 million metricton per year ethane cracker as well as two new polythene facilities each with an annual capacity of 500,000 metrictons. This is an attractive project one that takes advantage of existing infrastructure and advantaged feed s tock.Plant start-up is planned for 2017 .Turning now to slide 21, I'd like to close by highlighting our continued strong performance, particularly in ourupstream business. Our 2013 year-to-date upstream earnings margin was $23.33 per barrel. Based on these yearto-date results we continue to lead our direct peer group by a wide margin. We're almost $5.70 per barrel ahead ofour closest competitor. This is a position we have now held for 15 consecutive quarters. We also led on thisimportant metric at the six month mark by over $4.25 per barrel against a wide range of E&P companies. Thesepeer leading financial results are directly related to the quality of our investment decisions and the strength of ourportfolio.We appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company. I'd like to now open up themicrophone. Joe and I are happy to take your questions. We do have a full queue so please limit yourself to onequestion and a single related follow-up if that's necessary. We'll certainly do our very best to see that we get allyour questions answered.So, Jonathan, please open up the lines for questions.QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTIONOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.Your question, please?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ed G. WestlakeAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QGood morning, and thanks very much for getting Joe on the call. So I'll start with an LNG question. So I'm up latetonight and I keep getting these stories from Australia on my iPad, which are obviously going around the market.People are very worried about the LNG jetty or whatever it is – something else with the project. Maybe give us acolor on how you're feeling about the start-up date and maybe if there are any penalties if the date slips back intime – what's the sort of killer date to get Gorgon on stream? Thanks................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AOkay. Thanks, Ed, for the question. I think we have been pretty up front about acknowledging some of thechallenges that we've had earlier. We talked previously about logistics challenges, labor productivity and weatherchallenges. We have solved, for all practical purposes, the logistics challenges and in fact we've asked for and havereceived additional lay down space on the island. And so we're able to now build material and inventory onBarrow Island. Productivity – I would say is improving on all fronts but there are still some areas that still need toimprove. We are still impacted by weather. We had a heavy rainy period back in June but right now we're in thegood weather period and are making very good progress each month.I think we are moving into a critical phase from a schedule standpoint on the project. We talk about getting all theTrain 1 modules onto the island. That's proceeding pretty much as planned. I think that largely they will be hereby year-end or shortly into the New Year, maybe one that will be mid-quarter next year. What's important next isthe mechanical, electrical and, kind of, instrumentation work and construction – contractor work on thoseactivities is wrapping up on the island now. But there are still uncertainties that exist with a project of our size,and our challenge every day is to mitigate the risks, find the risks, mitigate the risks as they arrive. But the jetty, Ithink we tried to say, all the critical elements of the jetty, the main critical elements of the jetty, those that supportthe structural elements, are on plan.Right now we are in the process of finalizing our budgets for the year, and should there be any reviews during thatthat suggest a material change other than what we've said previously, we'll certainly bring that to your attention,but I don't have anything more to offer.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ed G. WestlakeAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QThanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp. AAnd let me – let me address your question on the marketing side. I'd like to say that our customers are ourpartners, so they fully understand the project challenges. I would also say that Gorgon is not coming up all atonce, it's one train at a time. So that gives us time to work with our partners and with our customers onaccommodating their needs, and we have those discussions ongoing all the time. I cannot address specificallywhat's in our contract with respect to penalties. As you can appreciate, thes e are commercial elements and Icannot address those.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ed G. WestlakeAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QThanks very much.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question,please?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC QYeah, good morning, everybody, and thanks for the LNG commentary as well as addressing that CapEx question.Just staying with Gorgon, Joe, I mean, can you update us on how the FEED on Train 4 is progressing, and what isthe interplay on Trains 1 and 3, their progress, and the ultimate decision upon expansion? Meaning, do yourpartners need to see more final Gorgon cost estimates before committing to the expansion? And albeit, to asignificantly lower unit cost expansion.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AYeah, I think, Evan, maybe I'll take the question around Train 4. I think we continue to work with our partners.We're all interested certainly in seeing this continue to progress. I think all of the JV partners are interestedthough in seeing Train 1 come up and seeing progress on 2 and 3, et cetera. Everybody wants to get anunderstanding of the cost structure. I also think that people want to get certainty around the fiscal and regulatoryregime. And as you know, there's been a change of government in Australia, and so a little bit of settling down andstability there would be appreciative. Those factors are going to be taken into account.I also think it's fair to say that the cost structure in Australia is different now than it was when Train 1 was taken.Trains 1 through 3 were taken to final investment decision back in 2009. The cost structure has elevated, and Ithink it's fair to say that that has put at risk some of Australia's kind of global competitiveness. So from a Chevronstandpoint, we're going to look at Train 4 and we're going to assess it under those new conditions, and we're goingto look at that relative to other opportunities that we've got in our portfolio, and look for that next investment tocompete with other opportunities.Obviously a Train 4 does have certain brownfield economic advantages to it, but we need to take those advantages,lay in the new macro conditions that we see in Australia, and take a look at the whole portfolio activity. Havingsaid all that, we are continuing on with environmental approvals for Train 4.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp. ASo maybe I'll add a bit of color commentary also, because the marketing is essential to Train 4. And for all of thereasons that Pat has mentioned, I would also say that the LNG market has different dynamics as well. Our job is tocontinue to find a customer for Train 4, which we continue to do. We believe the offerings of a Train 4 aredifferent than the offering of our other projects like Kitimat. Train 4 is an expansion, it's a brownfield expansion.Train 4 is exposure to Australia. Train 4, however, doe s not have equity, unlike Kitimat where we're offeringequity. So it really caters to a different set of customers, and in our view from a marketing perspective, it's trulynot competing with Kitimat, and I think that's important for us to say.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC QSo thank you. So to follow up is, that does that mean that the potential debottlenecking of trains one through threeis something that could potentially proceed a train four? I know there are three different tranches of potentialexpansion. Does it change the debottlenecking opportunity and move that forward or is that still something thatwould follow if it did in fact fallout?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AYeah, I think, Evan, that we would – debottlenecking is always something that you would do as an ordinary courseof activity and oftentimes it has the very highest economics associated with it. So that will be taken into account inour normal planning process.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC QOkay, great. I'll leave it for somebody else. Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AThanks, Evan.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Societe Generale. Yourquestion, please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John P. HerrlinAnalyst, SG Americas Securities LLC QYeah, hi. Just two quick ones. With the Duvernay wells, Pat, about how much were they running? I know inscience time – it's early days but just wanting an approximate cost.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AYou're talking approximate well costs?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John P. HerrlinAnalyst, SG Americas Securities LLC QWell costs...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AYeah, that's not a number that we want to give out at this point in time.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John P. HerrlinAnalyst, SG Americas Securities LLC QOkay. That's fine. Next one's on LNG. Are you surprised at all that on the demand side, in terms of customers, thatthey haven't built more physical gas storage in Asia? And do you think that will change as the LNG market buildsup more?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp. AThat's a very good question, John. This is Joe here. And it's going to take time for them to get there. Clearly thereis some capacity with the regas terminals. We're seeing that in Thailand, we're seeing that in Singapore. Butremember that market is huge, so significant amount of storage has to be made available for it to really make adifference. I think we may get there eventually but I see a slow pace to get to that point.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John P. HerrlinAnalyst, SG Americas Securities LLC QOkay, great. Thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America MerrillLynch. Your question, please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, BofA Merrill Lynch QThanks, folks, and, Joe, good to hear you on the call. If I could try two also please. Joe, first of all can you remindus what the contract resets look like on your base load marketing for Gorgon in particular? And maybe whenyou're addressing the question, if you could talk a little bit about whether the issue around Henry Hu b pricing isreally more about delinking in the event oil for example went to 150 bucks as opposed to actually depressing thecurrent price. And I've got a follow-up, please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp. AI'll start by saying that most contracts that are of that length – 20 year – for them to be sustainable and to be winwinfor both customer – for buyer and seller have reopeners on them. Without getting into specifics, these arereopeners are meant to really make sure the pricing formula continues to reflect the market. What I can tell youthat all of our projects are paced, that we were not going to see major renewal for a big portion of the volume all inone year. We've been very careful in pacing these renewables over time because again that's in our interest and inthe buyer's interest to spread that renewal timing over a longer frame than just having them all occur in the sametime.Back to your questions on Henry Hub. There are two elements to it. We have been public in saying that LNG thatcomes out of the United States – made in the United States it's perfectly okay for it to be priced off of Henry Hub.LNG that is made in Australia, East Africa or Canada – it's a harder proposition to see why you would introduce aregional market reference to those markets. So that's been very difficult. In terms of breaking the oil linkage I willtell you that for the last 40 years the industry has learned to operate within an oil framework that saw oil prices goup to $140 and go down to $20.I submit to you that within these traditional frameworks you can introduce S curves, you can moderate slopes –there's a lot of other levers that actually work to prevent LNG from becoming very unaffordable in the regionswhere affordability is becoming an issue. So I think we can address those excursions that could be harmful froman affordability point of view within a traditional framework without necessarily going to something unproventhat could also be a lot more volatile.We've also said that one way for people to get better attenuation on price is for them to get into the equity side.That clearly gives them direct exposure to the upstream side to the whole value chain and effectively you aregetting an attenuation of the pricing because you're getting the whole value chain benefits from that. Hopefullythat helps.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, BofA Merrill Lynch QIt does a lot. Thanks, Joe. My follow up hopefully is a bit quicker. We all watched the unit earnings trends, thevery strong unit earnings trends you guys have had for quite some time now. But whatever you want to look at,earnings or cash flow, the focus is earnings. And I guess my question is, your DD&A runs about $6.00 lower thanyour peer group and that appears to be trending higher. When you have all this non-producing capital comingonline from these new projects, can you give us a feel as to how the DD&A trend is going to look? And I'll leave itat that. Thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. ARight. So, Doug, I think you should expect – we have seen and you should expect the trend to continue, highercharges for DD&A. Certainly that's the pattern we've seen over the last couple of years. It's the pattern that we seelooking at 2013 versus 2012. It is the expectation I would have going forward for 2014. It is a direct reflection ofthe capital investment programs that we have had underway and as we bring those now projects online, we seerate increases associated with that.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, BofA Merrill Lynch QAll right. I'll leave it there. Thanks, Pat.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. ADoug, I guess I would say it's important even with that, we still have the leading earnings-per-barrel margin andwe have the leading cash margin.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, BofA Merrill Lynch QI was just trying to figure out what the future trend is going to look like when these projects come up, Pat.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AI appreciate that.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Chevron Corp.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital. Your questionplease?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. QHey, guys. Good morning. Two somewhat related questions. One's for Joe and I think one for Pat. For Joe, whenwe look at Kitimat, if you can give us some idea of what is the competitive position relative to building an LNGplant in Kitimat and operating there, which is a pretty remote area and labor could be an issue comparing to inAustralia where you guys have a lot of operation, or in the Gulf of Mexico, which you don't have a lot of operation.So that's the first one.Pat, do you want me to give you the second one first?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. ASure. Go ahead.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. QIf I look at – this is not an issue in the near term, but your current cash flow essentially just barely covered yourCapEx. And so at what point – now of course when you have zero net debt, that is not an issue today. Buttheoretically, that from management standpoint at what point do we start questioning whether you want tocontinue to borrow money to buy -back stock and at what point will that continue? Once that you eliminate theshare buy -back that you will have to re-look at your CapEx program?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AOkay. Good question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp. AI'll go first, Paul, on the Kitimat question. It's very good question. I will start by talking a little bit a bout theresource base. If you look at our acquisition of that resource base we're very, very pleased with the entry price.And we also know that we have a huge resource base in both Liard and the Horn River. That resource base sitsright at the gates of North Asia where we continuously see increased demand. So strategically it is very wellpositioned for North Asia buyers. Our buyers see that and that's the value proposition we've been communicatingto them.They also see in Kitimat two partners that have complementary skills, that are very aligned and very committed tothe project. They see a federal government and a provincial government that are supportive and understand theopportunity. They see a country that is very much in favor of exports and tilting toward Asia. They see a projectwith export permits in hand and a clear line of sight on a pipeline and a transportation solution.Now you did say something about the labor costs. I will tell you, though, if we're the first out of the gate, we willhave an ability to attenuate that versus being the last one coming in to develop the project. And finally what we tellour buyers, this is a great opportunity for them to participate through equity and the whole value chain. In doingso they really get direct exposure to North America gas pricing.All of those are good value drivers for any buyer in north Asia. They're getting it. I think we're getting goodreception and obviously time will tell in our ability to sign contracts. But we're very encouraged b y what we seeand the value that Kitimat can offer to those buyers. And I'll go back to Pat for the CapEx question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. QBill, before that, from a core standpoint, do you – from what you can – because you know a lot about Australiaand I assume you know quite a lot about Gulf Coast. Is developing cost and operating cost of Kitimat going to becompetitive with Australia but cheaper than Gulf Coast or any kind of insight that you can provide?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp. AIt is too early for us. I would remind you that we signed the transaction in February this year. We became operatorin July of this year. We are really getting on top – there are two things here that we need to be very careful on, it'sproject development and execution, which is really where we're focused on, and secondly the marketing, and theyhave to go hand-in-hand. I will tell you though, the freight advantage that we see in Western Canada clearly issomething in favor of Canada compared to Gulf Coast exports.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AOkay. And, Paul, just going back to your question, I want to start with the priorities that we've always put outthere in terms of uses of cash: dividends first, reinvesting in the business, taking care of our balance sheet, andthen share repurchases really come at the very tail end of that. And you're right, we are in a period right nowwhere our capital requirements are high.Just to remind you, we've got five LNG trains under construction. That's a very significant component. We do nothave – we do not see in the forward look that we will have anything as lumpy as that or as sized as that. So weknow 2013 is a high C&E year. We have said in the past that 2014 will be a high C&E year. George referenced lasttime on the call about a flattening that will occur. So we do see that the uniqueness of our capital spend periodright now is not something that we see coming forward in future years.At the same time, though, we do fundamentally believe our greatest value proposition for our shareholders isfinding and investing in the right resources and developing the right projects, and so we will continue to invest inthe business. And so, you see us doing that in terms of resource acquisitions that I talked about earlier.So we try very hard to balance this returns and growth equation here, and we've been very successful. Thedecisions that we have made, and we believe the new resource acquisitions that we have made for the future, forgrowth 2020 and beyond, are excellent projects. So we believe we're putting that equation together quite nicely.I guess the other thing that I would say is, when you bring in new resource acquisitions like we've done withKurdistan or Cooper Basin or Kitimat, et cetera, when you're adding those elements to your portfolio, it does meanthat you reprioritize your portfolio, and certain things probably fall towards the bottom. These would be moremature assets, less competitive in our portfolio, believe that they have potentially a spot in someone else'sportfolio, and that's where your asset sale or your portfolio optimization component increases.We've been very good at doing that in downstream, you've seen us do all that restructuring in downstream, Joehas overseen a fair amount of restructuring occurring in our midstream area, and I think you can expect someadditional asset sales now coming forward from upstream.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. QAnd is there some form of matrix that you look at, from a financial net debt to capital or net debt to EBITDA youwould look at, say, once you reach a certain level for the share buyback will, say, maybe that comes to a halt?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AWe obviously are interested in maintaining our double -A status, credit rating status. We're not interested ininfringing upon that at all, so we look at that as kind of a limi ting factor. But frankly, Paul, we are such a long wayaway from that at this point, it's not a limiting component.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. QThank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AThank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your question,please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Faisel H. KhanAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker) QGood morning. Two questions. First on the LNG facility in Canada, or potential LNG facility in Canada, can youdiscuss the merits of owning the entire integrated asset? And why not move into a more asset-light model where autility -like company owns the liquefaction facility? You own the resource and you market the gas and charter theships. I mean, it seems like it's a very large piece of invested capital. There's a lot of companies out there,especially in Canada and the U.S. that have the ability to finance this stuff at a much lower cost of capital.And then my follow up is that, it seems like building a pipeline from Liard and Horn River to Prince Rupert oreven to Kitimat, is very expensive. There's a lot of depreciated pipe all the way from there down to the Gulf Coastthat has a lower invested capital base. I mean, why not just ship the gas down there and sign up for one of theseother facilities that are sort of ramping up? So that's a little bit out of left field, but maybe you can help me answerthis.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp. ANo, it's not out of left field at all, Faisel. Good question. Let me tell you that we're not building a pipeline from thefield to the LNG facility. We are clearly leveraging existing trunk lines that currently run and they are o peratedand owned by others. The piece that we are building is the link from the front line to our facility. I call that ourumbilical and that's very essential for us to actually control that to control the feed going into the LNG facility. Sowhere we can we are leveraging other facilities, infrastructures, processing plants could be another place where weleverage as well. So we are adopting some of what you're suggesting.When we do this we always look at the strategic fit of the asset. Is it essential for us to control it from a commercialpoint of view? Is it essential for flow assurance to our facility? Those are normally governing criteria for us todecide whether we want to own the interconnecting framework.Same thing by ships. We can sell FOB as well and we don't have to build ships. But sometimes we have to buildships to ensure flow assurance on the back end of the LNG facility. The name of the game is really to get themolecules that we just acquired at a very attractive price in the Horn and Liard to the market and maximize ourreturns. And we look through that whole thing in details.And the other option is also we're looking at from lowering the capital investment we're asking other equitypartners to come in. And by farming in for buyers, clearly we are lowering the capital exposure. So we're looking atall of that to basically address the element of the question that you brought, Faisel.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Faisel H. KhanAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker) QOkay. And then the pipeline gas, if you could pipeline all this gas down to the Gulf Coast on what's basically all thisdepreciated pipeline whether it's Alliance or Northern Border and then down to GPL to the Gulf Coast. Theinvested capital of those assets is far lower than these pipeline s that TransCanada and Spectra are talking aboutbuilding to supply that gas to Canadian West Coast. Is that an opportunity where you can move that resourcedown to Gulf Coast and export it out of the Gulf Coast and with the Panama Canal opening up? It seems like anasset light model. But I don't know.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp. AFood for thought. Thank you, Faisel.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Faisel H. KhanAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker) QOkay. Fair enough. Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Yourquestion, please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Pavel S. MolchanovAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. QThanks very much. Two questions on your unconventional gas exposure. U.S. gas production was up almost 5%year-over-year. Is that primarily legacy Atlas acreage?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AI think there's both an Atlas component as well as a newer Permian Delaware Bas in component to that.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Pavel S. MolchanovAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. QOkay. Fair enough. And then on to Europe, lots of headlines recently involving countries where you guys areoperating or thought about operating in, Lithuania, Romania, et cetera. Any status update you guys want toprovide on how you're thinking about that?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AYeah, I think we've tried to say right from the get go that this would be a long-term development opportunity andthat it would take several years really to understand how the overall play could develop. We do think if it worksand if it's proven up then there's enough here to potentially build a business. But we're just in the ve ry early stagesof exploration and so I don't want us leaping too far too soon with implications here.We're active in Poland. We've drilled four wells there. We've got 3D seismic underway as well there. In Romania,we're picking up seismic activity. Ukraine we're still interested in having the PSA signed. We're hopefully gettingcloser on that. So we continue to make progress. It will be dependent upon the local governments and the localcommunities wanting to have us be there and so that's been a challenge. It is an exploration play and so I think weneed to give it time to mature.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Pavel S. MolchanovAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. QAll right. Appreciate it.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wel ls Fargo. Your question,please?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D. ReadAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC QYes. Good morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AGood morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp. AMorning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D. ReadAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC QI guess I'd like to – on the upstream side focus a little bit more on the cost side of things. Obviously it was a goodquarter in terms of realizations on the top line. But you talked a little bit earlier about DD&A being an issue. Isthere anything else maybe particular to the third quarter from an operating cost standpoint that's not recurring? Iknow maintenance has an issue sometimes but I was just seeing if you could help us there maybe think about howthat unfolds in 2014 and 2015.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AYeah, no. I think from a cost standpoint, so exploration was heavier in the third quarter than the second quarter.But if you look on a year-to-date basis, it's pretty much in line with what we have seen previously. We're seeinghigher industry costs, you referenced that. I think that's just a general trend that has been evident. But also,maintenance in the third quarter was a little bit heavier, kind of per -plan as well as some unplanned as well. So Ithink those were the factors that I would call your attention to.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D. ReadAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC QAnd in terms of any thoughts on 2014 and 2015? I mean, are we seeing trends here? I mean, I agree with your thatthe industry is seeing higher costs. But are there any trends specific to Chevron that we should think about? Oreven another way of asking it, as the LNG projects come on, are we going to see that as a significant impact maybelowering operating costs?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AYeah, I don't think there's anything unique in Chevron's operations going forward that I would suggest. And –well, I think I'll defer on the LNG operation side of things. We're – I'm not in a position to comment about whatop expense looks like in 2015 and 2016 at this point.Okay, I think we've got time for one more question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Allen Good from Morningstar. Your que stion,please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Allen GoodAnalyst, Morningstar Research QGood morning, everyone. Just a couple for Joe on LNG. You've been pretty detailed on the merits of Canadian gasrelative to Gorgon and relative to the U.S. Should we go ahead and take it that exporting natural gas out of theGulf Coast doesn't fit competitively within Chevron's current LNG portfolio?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp. AWell, you're making too many assumptions right there. We're focused on Kit imat for now. And again, we haveopportunities in Australia. We're not ruling anything out at this stage. But at the same time, I'm not prepared totell you that we won't look at opportunities anywhere else in the world. For now we're focusing on Canada.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Allen GoodAnalyst, Morningstar Research QOkay. Thanks. And then I guess finally, you mentioned the appeal of the equity availability in Kitimat for some ofyour potential partners. Is there a minimum equity stake that Chevron would like to retain in Ki timat, or viceversa, sort of a target that you'd like to sell down as a portion of equity in the project?Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp. AWe have not put any number out there. Obviously it's up to the buyer also to indicate interest. We kind of like anumber in our mind in terms of where we'll end up, but it's really a function of where the buyers are. We'reflexible, and remember we've got a partner as well and we've got to consult with them in terms of where they'd liketo end up. The gate is open, though, for the buyers to tell us what they think. I don't know that we have indicatedexternally what that number is, but we're open to entertain the buyers' ideas.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Allen GoodAnalyst, Morningstar Research QOkay. Thanks. And I'll just get one more quick one. If – you've been – you make a pretty convincing case thatdemand for LNG will be out there. Do you see any threats from the supply side, though, that could potentiallydisrupt the potential long-term economics for LNG projects?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Joseph C. GeageaPresident-Gas & Midstream Business, Chevron Corp. AIn fact, I see the threat in the opposite direction. I see the threat as, the longer it's taking us to enable projects toreach FID, and you fast-forward it four or five years how long it takes to build them, this market can only go up.And that is not really what the buyers would like and that's why our plea with the buyers have been, we need toenable supply to come to the market because we have not seen anything on the demand side that is managing thatcarefully. We see more subsidy, we see nuclear out of the energy mix, we see shale gas develop in a lot of placesslower outside of the United States.All of that point to more need for LNG, and I look at how many projec ts are actually reaching FID outside theUnited States, I don't see a whole lot. And that can only mean a problem down the road. So – and we've seen thatplay out in the past. Back in 2007 , there was an estimate of about 7 5 million tons of LNG that would h it themarket in 2014. As we sit today, there's only 10 million tons that will come in 2014. So we've got to crack thisequation, both from the supply side and the demand side, and the longer we see projects delay from reaching FID,I think the price equation gets more difficult.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Allen GoodAnalyst, Morningstar Research QOkay. Great. Thanks for that.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.Okay. Thanks for that – okay. Thank you. Before we close off the call, since we didn't get a question on Ecuador, Iwould like to provide our investors an update on this matter before we close out here. It's a very important matter.As you are probably well aware, there have been several recent positive developments related to this ongoinglitigation. Earlier in the year, several key witnesses, financiers and other associates, including an Ecuadorian judgeinvolved in the case publicly denounced and exposed numerous examples of the blatant fraudulent tactics used bythe plaintiff's lawyers during the trial.But more recently, an international tribunal convened under the authority of the U.S. Ecuador BilateralInvestment Treaty and administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague found that thesettlement and release agreements between the government of Ecuador and Texaco in the mid to late 1990sreleased Texaco Petroleum Company from any liability for all public interest or collective environmental claims.Now, this was a definitive ruling on the single most important legal issue in the case and it was made by animpartial tribunal in Hague where Chevron had picked one arbiter, the government of Ecuador had picked onearbiter and we both had agreed on the third, and it was a unanimous ruling.Importantly, this ruling confirms that the claims against Texaco were not valid and should not have been broughtin the first place. And it also signifies that efforts to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment, which the plaintiffs have sofar unsuccessfully attempted in both Canada and Argentina, that those are in direct violation of national andinternational laws.Now separately, a couple of weeks back, on October 15, the U.S. trial began in New York related to Chevron's civillawsuit against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters alleging RICOviolations, violations of the Racketeer, Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act. Trial proceedings in this NewYork lawsuit are expected to last a few more weeks. So we're encouraged by these recent developments, but at thesame time, we expect to need to continue to defend our position and defend our assets well into the future beforefinal resolution becomes available to us.So with that, I will close off finally. Here and again, thank you for your interest in the company and your time herethis morning. Good day to everyone.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.
