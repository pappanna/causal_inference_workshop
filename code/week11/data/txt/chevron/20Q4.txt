General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thank you, Audra. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call and webcast. Our Chairman and
CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. Also listening in today is Roderick Green, the
incoming General Manager of Investor Relations, who will assume the position effective April 1. Roderick and I
will be transitioning together over the next couple months.
It has been my sincere pleasure working with each of you over the last three years. Thank you for your excellent
questions, transparent feedback and investment in Chevron.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2.
Now, I'll turn it over to Mike.

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

All right. Thanks, Wayne. 2020 was an unprecedented year; a global pandemic resulting in a devastating loss of
life, a historic collapse in the global economy, and extremely volatile oil markets. We began the year in a strong
position, and we took swift action to adapt to the new realities as they emerged.
During last year's first quarter call, we shared our plan to manage through the crisis, grounded in our values and
keeping our strategic and financial priorities intact. Looking back, I'm pleased to say that we delivered on each of
these five commitments which I'll cover on the next slides.
First and foremost, we focused on the safety of our employees and our operations. Despite the difficult personal
challenges faced by everyone in our workforce and the additional health safeguards at our operating facilities,
2020 was our second safest year ever in terms of fatalities and our best ever on serious injuries, motor vehicle
crashes and loss of containment.
It was also the year with the greatest and most rapid change in market conditions. Our upstream team had to
quickly and safely demobilize dozens of rigs and reduce other production activities. Our refining personnel had to
figure out how to make as little jet fuel as possible, even though just weeks before jet was the fastest-growing
refined product.

Despite all this, our upstream delivered more than 3 million barrels per day for only the second time in the
company's history, and our refineries maintained world-class availability to deliver the energy required for
essential workers in a recovering economy.
I'm so proud of our employees, how they carried out their responsibilities with excellence and helped each other
and, during this extraordinary year, rose to overcome the unprecedented challenges.
Turning to capital and cost management. During last year's Investor Day, we told you our capital program was
flexible. And just weeks after we said that, we proved it. 2020 capital was down 35% from 2019 and organic
capital excluding incremental C&E from Noble in the fourth quarter was under $13 billion, well below our revised
guidance of $14 billion.
We also exceeded our guidance for operating cost savings. Excluding special items, OpEx was down by over $1
billion this year with decreases due to reduced activity levels and lower transportation, fuel and incentive
compensation costs. This demonstrates our ongoing cost and capital discipline, something you can count on and
a key to winning in this industry.
Moving to the next slide, we entered and exited the 2020 crisis with an industry-leading balance sheet, while also
completing a major acquisition. Early in 2020, we increased our dividend over 8%. We also bought back shares.
When the crisis hit and cash from operations decreased, we took action to halt the buyback and protect our
balance sheet. We completed asset sales, received good value, and finished our three-year high grading program
in the middle of our guidance range.
Being prepared with a strong balance sheet, consistent with an ongoing asset sales program and adaptive on
share repurchases enabled us to increase our annual dividend payout for the 33rd consecutive year. And the
actions we took to preserve long-term value, which I'll cover on the next slide, should give our shareholders
confidence that we intend to sustain and grow the dividend in the future.
Turning to slide 7, while we reduced short-cycle capital that would bring on near-term production, we maintained
capital for projects that we expect to deliver production and attractive cash flow for years like our expansion
project in Kazakhstan. And in the Permian Basin and other short-cycle basins, we preserve the capability to build
investment backup when the conditions are right. In addition, we were the first to announce and complete a major
acquisition, showing the way with a low-premium equity deal at an opportune time.
And as a result, our total investment over 2020 and 2021 will likely be in line with our pre-crisis guidance. But we'll
get there in a much different way with much lower organic capital that would have added more barrels to already
oversupplied markets offset by an acquisition for low-cost barrels already producing. That also translated to
reserve replacement, with additions from the Noble acquisition mitigating reserve demotions from reduced capital
investments and price effects as disclosed in last year's 10-Qs.
Committed employees, capital and cost discipline, decisive actions that balance the short and long term that was
our playbook to manage through this crisis. And while we're not out of it yet, we look to the future with optimism.
We believe we're better positioned than others, confident in our ability to succeed in any environment.
Turning to slide 8, I'm also proud that we maintained our commitment to ESG, a commitment we've long held and
one that doesn't ebb and flow with market cycles. We increased actions to advance a lower carbon future, abating
emissions in our operations, starting up our first renewable natural gas plants, and investing in low-carbon
technologies like our recent announcement with carbon utilization startup, Blue Planet.

We completed our largest company restructuring in 20 years and integration of Noble employees in a transparent
and equitable manner. And we maintained positive relationships with our suppliers and supportive relationships
with communities where we operate.
Lastly, we continued strong governance, which starts with our exceptional Board of Directors during an
unprecedented year to meet the interests of all our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Mike. We reported a net loss of $700 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings were about
breakeven. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation.
Excluding working capital changes, cash flow from operations was almost $4 billion for the quarter. Our Brent oil
cash breakeven price, excluding working capital, was under $50 for the second quarter in a row. C&E was $3.2
billion including about $200 million for legacy Noble assets.
Full year financial results were significantly lower due to weak market conditions as reflected by an adjusted
ROCE near zero. We remain committed to improving returns on capital and will share more about our plans to do
so at our Investor Day in March.
Total shareholder distributions, including first quarter buybacks, were $11.4 billion. And we ended the year with a
net debt ratio in the low 20s after the assumption of Noble debt and a step-up to market value.
Turning to slide 10; adjusted fourth quarter earnings were down about $200 million compared to third quarter.
Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily due to higher volumes from Noble Energy and higher commodity
prices. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased due to negative timing effects, including an end of year
inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million, higher operating expenses, primarily due to turnarounds
and higher RIN credit prices. The other segment decreased primarily due to higher pension charges related to
lump sum elections.
Turning to our full year earnings; adjusted earnings decreased by over $12 billion compared to the prior year.
Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily on lower prices. An under-lift and the mix effect of higher US and
lower international liftings also lowered earnings.
Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower volumes and margins, unfavorable timing effects
and higher RIN and other credit prices. The other segment loss increased primarily due to higher pension
expense.
Slide 12 shows our production outlook for 2021 assuming a $50 Brent price. We expect production to be up 3%
higher than last year, excluding the impact of any asset sales that may close in 2021.
Our projected growth is driven by a full year production from the Noble Energy assets and lower expected
curtailments, partially offset by higher base declines in part due to lower capital last year, price effects, an
accounting change in Venezuela, 2020 asset sales, and upcoming contract expirations.

Note that our Rokan concession in Indonesia expires in August of this year. And while our contract in Thailand
does not expire until March of next year, production is decreasing due to the short time to earn a return on new
investments.
Now, looking ahead. In the first quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by 60,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia. Gorgon Train 1 repairs are nearing completion and we
expect the facility to be back online in March. After Train 1 is back online, Train 3 will be taken out of service for
the propane vessel inspections, any repairs and the planned turnaround.
At Wheatstone, production is modestly below capacity while we repair an inlet separator. We do not expect
production impacts in the second quarter. The impact from ongoing OPEC+ curtailments is estimated to be
40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day primarily in Kazakhstan.
At TCO, our project workforce reached 20,000 by year-end before we paused due to a virus resurgence. Next
month, we expect to resume remobilization for the spring campaign and are targeting a project workforce of
26,000 by the end of the first quarter.
In Indonesia, we expect cost-recovery barrels to decrease 75,000 barrels per day from last quarter. One-time prefunding for drilling and ARO commitments in the fourth quarter contributed to the working capital build. We expect
these receivables to reverse by the third quarter. And downstream turnaround activity in the first quarter is
expected to have an estimated after-tax earnings impact of $100 million to $200 million. Other financial guidance
items are shown on the slide.
With that, back to Mike for his closing comments.

Michael K. Wirth

All right. Thanks, Pierre. 2020 was a year like no other. And while there are uncertainties and challenges ahead,
we are optimistic about the future. We are stronger with Noble, which has geographic diversity and plays to our
strengths. We're starting the year with an industry-leading balance sheet again.
We're executing a disciplined investment program that grows enterprise value with greater capital efficiency. We
remain committed to our number one financial priority, sustaining and growing the dividend, and we're advancing
a lower carbon future with actions that are good for the environment and good for shareholders.
We hope that you'll join us on March 9 to discuss these topics and more during our 2021 Chevron Investor Day.
With that, I'll turn it back to Wayne.

Thanks, Mike. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Devin McDermott at Morgan Stanley.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Devin J. McDermott
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The first one I had here was just on the capital allocation
strategy as we think about the next few years. And you put the release out back in December cutting the capital
budget over the next several years to $14 billion to $16 billion and, as part of that, noted that as Tengiz spend in
Kazakhstan rolls off you would increase spending in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico. And I was wondering if you
could comment on the role of those US assets in your portfolio in light of the current policy and regulatory
backdrop, particularly the Gulf of Mexico, how you're thinking about that US concentrated investment strategy in
light of and current policies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Devin. Look, there's a couple of things here that I think are important to recognize. Number
one, not only have we transitioned over the last few years into what I would describe as a structurally lower
ongoing capital program, but, number two, it contains a much greater degree of flexibility. We mentioned we
pulled spending down 35% really over nine months last year because we could flex that downward.
And so we have a great degree of flexibility. We've got a high degree of capital efficiency in our portfolio. And
even at these further reduced levels of spending, as Pierre mentioned, production will be somewhere between flat
and up 3%. So we've got a capital program that we like, and as the TCO project comes down, we've got room to
make choices. When we issued the press release, certainly, the Permian and the Gulf of Mexico would've been
some of the first places to draw that capital back.
As we look at some of the announcements of this week and developments that seem to be unfolding here in the
US, it's early days to understand exactly how these will play out. The executive order was sweeping and broad,
but it also lacked some specificity. And I think, certainly, as you listen to some of the members of the new
administration comment as they introduced this and answered some questions, I think they're looking to flesh out
the details here in the coming weeks and months. And we certainly hope to be engaged in those conversations.
Onshore in the Permian, we're weighted towards Texas more so than New Mexico. We're weighted toward private
land more so than federal land. So we've got a fair degree of flexibility there, and that remains a highly attractive
place for us to step capital up as we have the capacity to do so and the market conditions support it. So, I think
that the Permian equation looks pretty similar to what it did at the time we made those statements.
Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, I think we just have to see how this unfolds. And certainly, we like the projects that
we're advancing here, and there's been, I think, general signaling that existing leases are secure. And we would
presume the permitting that would go with those leases is also likely to proceed, but there are questions about
this that I think we're just going to have to work our way through. So the risks are probably greater in the Gulf of
Mexico. That was probably the lower part of the capital step up that we might've envisioned at any rate. So I think
we'll be able to manage our way through it.

But stay tuned. We'll keep talking to you about this as we go forward. And of course, we got options outside of the
US as well, and I think that's important to just bear in mind. If conditions in the US become so onerous that it
really dis-incentivizes investment, we've got other places where we can take those dollars.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Devin J. McDermott
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And then my second question is just on TCO and Kazakhstan. I was wondering
if you could give us just an update on progress there and how things are progressing versus your expectations?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. So, quickly, I'll reiterate that last year we completed all module fabrication and all the transportation to get
the modules through the Russian inland waterway systems through the Caspian, unloaded into site. That's a
really important milestone because those were risks that could have extended things had we not accomplished
that.
Progress overall in the project is about 81% at this point. Construction's about 60% complete, and as Pierre said,
we've re-mobilized 20,000 workers to the project. We've plateaued at that number now because Tengiz is
experiencing some of the same wintertime uptick in coronavirus cases as you are seeing around the world. And
so, we're holding at 20,000 right now. We've had to quarantine certain portions of the workforce there for certain
periods of time. We plan to restart further mobilization in February, and as Pierre said, targeting 26,000 by the
end of the first quarter.
We'll need to get some progress under our belt here to really see data on productivity. There's a lot of work that
hasn't been done over the last going on a year now as this has been impacting us, and so we're working on
optimizing schedules and work plans and understanding what the full impact of that is. It's hard to quantify that
until we really are back at work. And certainly, in the wintertime, things tend to slow down. Summertime, they'll
pick up. And so we need to see our ability to sustain the workforce there to get work done productively and begin
to chew into this backlog that has built up. And we'll keep you advised as to what that looks like.
Jay will be with us at the Investor Day in six weeks, and he'll be able to give you more detail at that point in time. I
don't believe, by that point in time, we will have enough activity that we've seen where we'll be able to give you a
highly reliable specific update on cost and schedule. But we will be working on that and we will get it to you when
we've got enough data to give you something that we think is really useful.

Morning, Phil.

Phil Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

First question, the 2021 production guidance, the high-end growth of 3%, is slightly below where consensus is
here. And you gave some color there on Gorgon and Wheatstone for the first quarter which was very helpful. So, I
guess is it fair to assume that the extent of the downtime at Gorgon and Wheatstone that's in your guidance is just
kind of what's in the first quarter? And just maybe any color on what you're factoring in for the Permian as well for
2021? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. First thing I'll say, Phil, and I know everybody looks at production, but it's an outcome. And we're running
the company to deliver financial results and we let the production be what it is. Pierre gave you a guide for first
quarter on Gorgon and Wheatstone. Wheatstone for the rest of the year should be back up to full capacity until a
turnaround that begins late third quarter and runs into fourth, which we'd already planned and announced.
And then of course at Gorgon, as Pierre mentioned, Train 3 will have inspection of these propane exchangers and
a planned turnaround here in the second quarter of this year. So we will be lighter on Australia production [ph]
then with (23:20) everything up and running for a full year, but a big part of that is planned turnaround activity and
then there's an increment related to these repairs.
In the Permian, there's two pieces to think about. Overall Permian production will be up because we've added
production from Noble. I think we've previously guided to kind of a 6% to 7% decline on the Chevron legacy
production. That actually today looks like it will be a little less steep, maybe more like a 5% decline on Chevron
legacy production in 2021 versus 2020. And that's with flat activity levels running five rigs and one or two
completion crews over the course of the year.
And a little bit of this will be dependent upon what NOJV partners do. We ended the year last year with about 1.4
net rigs in the Permian on the NOJV; 7 gross, our share about 1.4. In January, it's up a little bit to about 2.5 net
rigs, 10 gross. So there's a little bit of perhaps upside depending upon what non-operated JV partners do. But
those are the key pieces there on both Australia and the Permian for production.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. And Phil, I'll just add that Venezuela year-on-year is down, right? We changed our accounting midyear last
year to where we're no longer booking production and reserves associated with those operations. We do continue
to have curtailments this year, which is also factored in. Australia year-on-year is not a big variance. It's flat to
modestly down. Again, we operated a big portion of 2020 with the train down at Gorgon. So that's not a big driver
of the year-on-year change.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


Q

Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you. My follow up would just be just on capital allocation. The balance
sheet, obviously, still looks very strong. Pierre, you said your dividend coverage was below $50 Brent, I think, for
a second straight quarter, and that's despite downstream still being soft. So, with oil here in the 50s, I think some
people are maybe a little surprised you didn't increase your dividend the other day, recognizing we're still in the
midst of a pandemic. But just any thoughts you could share around capital allocation if oil does indeed stay here
in the 50s.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, well, a couple things maybe in response to that, Phil. Thanks for recognizing we are still in the middle of a
pandemic. Demand is still off in total. The global economy is functioning at below its capacity, and I think there's
uncertainty out there. And certainly, oil prices today are supported in part by a unilateral move by Saudi Arabia to
take 1 million barrels a day off the market. And so, while we see inventories coming down and things trending
back towards balance, that process is still underway. And so we want to be mindful of the uncertainties in the
commodity price environment, and there could be some downside risk.
So, all that said, maybe two other points. One, while for the last three years we announced a dividend increase in
the first quarter, if you go further back over the last decade, it was never a first quarter increase. It actually was in
other quarters. And so we don't necessarily have a pattern or a kind of a preference for when the dividend
increase would occur. It's really based on our assessment of both short-term and long-term conditions,
affordability, et cetera, and it's a board decision, and the board reviews that every quarter.
So I hope our words but more our actions over recent years have demonstrated to you and to our shareholders
that the dividend is our number one priority. We have not changed that. Others have. Others have made moves
and reshuffled priorities and reset dividends and all the rest. We have not. And we were guided through this by
those financial priorities, and we're very mindful of what our investors look for, why they hold our stock, and that's
certainly something that will be part of our discussions as we go forward.
Last comment to your hypothesis; if we stay in a $55 Brent world for all of this year, we're in a very strong position
from a cash flow standpoint. Our breakeven is in the 40s, and so we'd be free cash flow positive and that certainly
is supportive of a dividend increase.

Jeanine Wai

Q

And I also like to congratulate Wayne, and thanks for putting up with all of us for so many years. Thanks. My first
question is, again, on shareholder returns. Chevron's prior $19 billion to $22 billion medium-term CapEx range, I
believe that was based on $60 Brent and it left room for about $5 billion a year of buybacks. So can you talk about
how your updated 2022 to 2025 CapEx guidance, how – if we should think that that range still also leaves room
for ratable annual buybacks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, it'd be a function, Jeanine, primarily of commodity price, right? So we've outlined that budget premised on a
lower price than $60 because we've been through this pandemic and we expect only a gradual recovery in the
global economy which would support gradual recovery in commodity prices.
So we've prepared ourselves for a difficult set of market conditions, which is certainly what we saw last year, if –
and as I just mentioned to Phil, we can hold production flat to grow at these capital levels. And so we're in a
position to consider dividend increases and share buybacks if we see an economic recovery and commodity price
environment that supports that.
The fundamental premise that we outlined at $60 continues to be our premise, which is disciplined capital
spending, a commitment to the dividend, and a return of surplus capital above and beyond that to shareholders,
premised upon a strong balance sheet and the other things that we always talk about within our priorities.
So we'll lay out a little more detail on this in March for you so that you can understand what this would look like
under different price scenarios and how we might allocate capital or the flexibility we'd have for capital
distributions under different price scenarios. So stay tuned for more discussion in March.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeanine Wai
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Okay. I'll stay tuned for that. My second question is on the energy transition. I guess how does the current
extremely low cost of capital for energy transition projects, energy transition companies, how does that impact
your view on the speed of the transition and the potential to create lots of capacity that's potentially uneconomic,
but nonetheless, it still erodes oil and gas demand? So I guess your views on that and how can Chevron compete
in that type of environment? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah. So, certainly, this is a space that's getting a lot of love from investors right now. And you see it in EV startups, you see it in solar start-ups, you see it in a lot of different technologies. And look. We're supportive of all of
the above. We want to see advancements in growth in renewables. We fully expect a lower carbon energy system
in the future.
I think you put your finger on one thing that needs to be watched is things that are supported by low interest rates,
lots of investor enthusiasm and government policy may work in the short term. The question is when the tide
starts flowing in other direction and when a day comes that interest rates are up, maybe investor perceptions shift
a little bit and maybe government policy shifts a little bit. Have we invested in things that can sustain in that
environment? And I think that's – we hope that they can, and we want to see the diversification in the energy mix
to meet growing demand around the world and lower carbon.
The last thing I'd say is I'm not this necessarily erodes energy demand as fast as some might believe or oil and
gas demand as fast as some might believe. A lot of it is going into power. That displaces coal. It, in some cases,
creates capacity that is intermittent and can't be used all the time and actually requires natural gas to create grid
stability and supply reliability. And so there's not necessarily a one-for-one displacement on all of these
investments. And that requires thoughtful study of the whole energy system to really understand how it's evolving
and how this capacity plays against all the other different sources of energy.

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Good morning. Thanks for taking some time this morning. And let me congratulate Wayne as well and appreciate
the time and friendship over the years.
Let me kick it off here on downstream. When we think about our model, upstream did okay, downstream was a
clear miss relative to our projections. And it's not surprising just given how tough demand was in the fourth
quarter. We are seeing cracks move in the right direction with line of sight to OPEC barrels coming back into the
market. Do you guys envision a downstream ahead? And how do you think about your refining configuration to
capture that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. So you're right. Downstream conditions have still been tough. Demand is off. It's off differentially across
different parts of the product barrel, which continues to stress the refining system. And then the amount that it's off
varies quite a bit regionally, right? So, in China, things are back to normal by and large. Other parts of Asia, pretty
darn close; Europe/North America, not so much. So it's a gradually healing system, but it's different in different
parts of the world. And refining markets are regional. And they're interconnected globally, but fundamentally they
start out regionally.
So we're looking for improvement over the course of this year, but I wouldn't call it a full recovery. I think it's,
again, it's a gradual process, and we're certainly heavy on the West Coast and heavy in Asia. And so, in Asia,
things are, as I said, a little bit better, but on the West Coast they are still recovering. So I think downstream in
2021 I would expect to be better than it was in 2020, but we're not anticipating pre-pandemic downstream
earnings and performance this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Hey, Neil, if I could just give a little more on the fourth quarter. I made a reference to this year-end inventory
adjustment. I'll just explain that. It was more than $100 million. So, during the course of the year, you're costing
inventory at average cost of the commodities. At year-end, you see if you've built or drove relative to prior year
layers. And so the good news is we drew.
We took our inventory levels down, so good management of working capital. But we drew into prior year layers
that were higher costed. And so that's only something we do at year-end in the fourth quarter. You're not doing it
during the year because you don't know if you're going to go into prior year layers in the intervening quarter. So,
you don't want to be always doing this calculation.
But our practice is at year-end. We revalue that so you have – think of it as inventory that had been valued at $42
during the course of the year. When we go into prior year layers, we're picking it up at $60 or $70. And there's no
cash impact, but there is a one-time kind of P&L effect. We don't call it a special item because it happens every
year. It just happened this year through good inventory management we actually drew down into prior year layers
which were higher costed.

Q

Thanks, Pierre. That makes a ton of sense. And the follow up is you guys acquired Noble towards the bottom of
the cycle. Mike, you built a reputation as being a good dealmaker and being willing to walk away when the bid/ask
goes the wrong way. Just do you still see it as a buyer's market out there? And do you still see attractive
opportunities, whether it's US E&P or elsewhere in the portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth

A

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. So it's still a tough market, and you would say that, in general, I would say both companies and asset
valuations are down from where they've historically been. So there's opportunity in circumstances like that, and
we've got the capacity to consider doing things. We may have passed the bottom. Hopefully, we have from the
standpoint of commodity and other cycles here. And we're alert to opportunities.
It may be that as companies come back in terms of their equity valuation, there are still a lot of people that are
carrying a fair amount of debt and have indicated the desire to sell assets in order to repair their own balance
sheets. So we could see a market where there are more asset sellers than there are buyers which could offer
some opportunities at an asset level. And so, we'll be aware and alert to those things.
The nice thing is we're not in a position where we have to do anything. We strengthened ourselves significantly
with a very good deal last year. We've got plenty of inventory to work on for many, many years to come, and
anything we would do would have to, A, fit strategically into a strong portfolio and, B, would have to compete for
capital in a strong portfolio. And so we'll continue to hold the bar very high and only consider things that would
really make a lot of sense.

Q

Hey, guys. Good morning. First, just want to say thank you to Wayne over the last three years for all the help and
insights, and wish you the best in your next role. Two questions, Mike and Pierre. One, want to go back into the
federal leases exposure. Can you share with us, in the Permian over the 2019 and 2020, what percent of your
activity is actually in the federal division?
I understand that federal division might be only about 10%, 15% of your overall Permian land position. But want to
see that on a P2P level how that look like. Also that how many permit that you have already in hand in the
Permian and whether you have all the needed permit for your program in the Gulf of Mexico this year. Also that if
you can just give us the production number in the fourth quarter in Permian, DJ and [ph] Duvernay (39:27).
The second question is on the ESG and the carbon new product or service. We understand you are not interested
going into the renewable power like solar and wind, but is there any other new product or service related to ESG
and carbon you think you have the technology that you can build it into a new business? And not just as a
concept, but as a new business. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Hey, Paul. It's Pierre. I'll start with your first question. I think we'll take some of it offline with Wayne and the IR
team in terms of production from the various basins. Our federal acreage, as you said, in the Permian is less than
10%. It went down little bit through the Noble acquisition. We're not going to disclose the activity for the last year
and how much was the mix. I think you can find publicly available data and you can chase that down.
In terms of the Gulf of Mexico, I think it's well-known that permits tend to – you have a lower inventory of permits,
so if we have a bigger inventory of permits in the Permian basin, we and other operators do, that's not the case in
the Gulf of Mexico. So those permits tend to be a lower inventory.
I will just point out that we have one floating rig on a long-term contract in the Gulf of Mexico that expires at the
end of the year. So we'll, again, take your other detailed questions offline. And then, Mike, do you want to answer
the energy transition?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, I was thinking about the first question. And so energy transition, if I caught it, Paul, what technologies are
we interested in. I think we've indicated carbon capture and storage for sure. We've recently made an investment
in another carbon storage technology start-up, and you can expect to continue to hear more from us on that front.

And then, of course, hydrogen should be in our wheelhouse. We manufacture hydrogen today. We've sold
hydrogen before at retail, and we should have the toolkit to take what is technically feasible today but not
economically practical and look for ways to drive costs down and scale up hydrogen over time.
And so, I can't promise you we're going to get that to a point where it's fully competitive with the alternatives
today, but that's an area that few companies have the capability to do all the things required, and we're one of the
types of companies that should be able to work on that. So those will be two areas you can expect to see us
active in.

Q

Mike, Chevron's equity has handily outperformed S&P Energy since you became CEO a few years ago as focus
or decisiveness, as I think you like to call it, on higher returns on capital and lower debt and lower dividend
breakevens have been a winning formula with energy investors. Simultaneously, the pace of change in the
industry seems to be quickening not only as it relates to policy which you talked about a minute ago and likely
future energy mix, but also that which is expected from investments in the sector.
So my question is a couple-fold. Number one, how do you guys think about how to navigate this evolving
environment which is somewhat different? Two, are technical and strategic dexterity likely to be needed maybe
more than in the past? And then finally, what might be the implications for financial strategy in this new
environment or is it too early to know?

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

On your questions, I think a lot of the fundamentals that we've been exhibiting in our strategy will continue to
serve shareholders well as we go forward. It's the capital and cost discipline. It is the ability to meet the needs of
today's markets while also investing for tomorrow's markets. And with a diversified portfolio we have across
business lines and across geographies, we can mitigate market and regulatory risk that may emerge in one
country because we've got a footprint that allows us to shift resources and capital allocation to other parts of our
portfolio.
So, for 140-plus years, this is what we've been doing. You're right, things are evolving now, but they've been
evolving for quite some time. And I think the capabilities we have in our organization, the honest dialogue we try
to have with everybody about how do you meet the growing demand for energy and the desire to see the mix
change? And how do we continue to invest where we have advantages in both the existing core business and
emerging new businesses is what you will see us continue to do.
At the core, I think the financial priorities stay the same. We are committed to the dividend. We're committed to
organic reinvestment in order to support that dividend, and that can be reinvestment across the entire spectrum of
energy technologies. Maintaining a strong balance sheet; we've seen this last year how important that is. And
then when we've got surplus cash after those first three needs to distribute that back to shareholders. That
framework is intact and I don't see that changing.

Q

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple. So, the first one is just around your comments around
generating free cash flow at prevailing commodity prices. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the balance
sheet and where you'd be comfortable in terms of gearing as you move through 2021. Also, Pierre, maybe you
can touch on the recent announcement from the S&P on potential changes in the credit ratings for the sector and
risk of the industry with the transition and how that is working into your thinking in managing the balance sheet.

And then the second question on a different topic, with Gorgon down in the quarter, presuming that's obviously a
decent hit to your LNG portfolio, can you confirm if you were buying spot LNG cargoes in the fourth quarter? And
just if you can give a rough sense of the quantity or the earnings impact on that because, I guess, that's more a
transitory nature given some of the issues there. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

All right. Thanks, Biraj. It's Pierre. I'll start. Look, Mike just went to our financial priorities, and we're in a good
place on a debt ratio. Our net debt ratio is under 23%. That includes the assumption of debt from the Noble
acquisition, which added about $9 billion of debt.
So I've talked about – we don't have a target net debt ratio range, but I've talked about a range between 20% and
25% is a good place to be over the cycle. We can be below that at times. We'd be heading up towards this range.
If we're above it for some reason, I'd want to have confidence that we're heading down that range. So it's not a
hard and fast target, but we're in a really good place with a leading balance sheet, low breakeven, as Mike talked
about, and very well positioned. We also have asset sales that we provided some guidance on here on the call.
In terms of the S&P, look, we work with them. It was an industry-wide call. I think our track record speaks for itself
in terms of being disciplined with capital, protecting the balance sheet, and being very progressive about the
future of energy and our approach of higher returns, lower carbon. So I think that lines up with the rating
agencies. But that's not something we control. That'll be up to them. We're managing the company for long-term
value; we think we're doing a good job.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Biraj, on your question on Australian LNG, a simple way to think about this is we've got 80% or so of our volume
termed up, and you can think about having a train down for a better part of this last quarter, so four out of five
trains running, so about 80% of our capacity. So we've been able to satisfy all of our term needs, and we're in the
market now with our commercial organization, buying a cargo here, selling a cargo there in and out of the spot
market. But we haven't been out of position and hurt because we had to buy high and sell low to any meaningful
degree through this whole cycle.

Q

Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Wayne, I want to wish you good luck and hoping Roderick gets in a little earlier
in the Q. But congratulations. Guys, I wonder if I could just go back to the capital allocation question very quickly,
Mike. You've now got Israel and a lot of growth opportunities that Noble had talked about longer term. And it
sounds like you're backing away a little bit from [ph] the need for (49:02) growth in the Permian. I'm just
wondering if, under Biden administration, is that how we should think capital allocation, international versus
domestic, now you've got bigger opportunity set.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

We'll have to see how things play out in the US. I don't want to overreact to that at this point in time till we know
more. But, fundamentally, we intend to continue to be very disciplined in the allocation of capital. Noble's assets in
Israel have the big part of their capital spend behind them right now. There's capacity to grow production there
with little or no incremental capital right now. And the nice thing is we bring some capabilities to bear here that
might not have been in Noble's wheelhouse.
So there's ways to take this gas further into regional markets. There's ways to take it into LNG, be it facilities that
[ph] have oilage (49:58) today that you could go into or Noble had been looking at an FLNG concept. There are
ways to take it to power markets and into power generation and regional power distribution across borders. And
there are opportunities to look at things like hydrogen and new energy technologies as well.
So we have the financial strength and capacity to underwrite things larger than perhaps Noble could have and
some technical capability and relationship depth in some of these markets that should be an advantage. And so
we'll look to use those to support the growth of the position in Israel. And in the broad capital allocation question
US versus other countries, we're always thinking about that, always looking at that and drawn by returns and risk.
And we'll continue to evaluate those things.

Doug Leggate

Q

Okay. I appreciate that. My follow up is maybe for Pierre and it's a follow up to the S&P question earlier. Whoever
– whichever one of you guys would like to answer this. But it's really more about the external pressures that
you're seeing, whether it be from one of your large peers seeing an active shareholder talking about big energy.
Your key investment community and, obviously, your European peers moving in that direction. And now you've
got the credit agencies. And it seems to me at least that the US side of the pond is still very much in the big oil
category in terms of how you see your opportunity set going forward.
I'm just curious, Mike or Pierre, how do you see these external pressures influencing discussions with the board,
discussions with investors and ultimately a longer-term energy mix? Will we see Chevron move towards that big
energy story over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, I'm going to come back. I think Pierre mentioned earlier that we describe our strategy with four simple
words; it's higher returns and lower carbon. And both of those things matter to the investors that we speak to. And
we're working hard on both fronts, and we've got to improve return on capital and demonstrate that we're going to
do that. And at the same time, we also have to prepare for a lower carbon energy system in the future.

And we're reducing the intensity of the energy we deliver today and making really good progress on that and will
continue to set new targets in that area because the world – stepping on the hose of supply through one way or
another doesn't really change demand. And so somehow demand will need to be met, and we think it should be
met by those that can do it in a way that has the lowest carbon impact. We're increasing the production of
renewable and lower carbon products for our customers, so they can reduce their energy intensity and carbon
intensity, and then likewise looking at these breakthrough technologies and I mentioned a couple of them earlier.
So, every company in the industry, Doug, is searching for the right mix. There's not an empirically observable
correct answer to this, and I think we're all working with our various stakeholders, right? Our boards, our
employees, our customers, the countries where we operate and the policies that we operate under to manage
both of these things.
And look, energy is the lifeblood of the global economy, and reliable, affordable energy will be fundamental to the
recovery from the pandemic in the short term. And in the longer term, it will be fundamental to lifting people out of
poverty around the world, and we have to remember that. And today's energy system is not the enemy. Lower
emissions are what we should be focused on. And that's what we as a company are focused on, and that's what
we talk to our stakeholders about, and that's what we're committed to doing.

Q

Mike, [indiscernible] (54:05) question. You've obviously addressed your strategy on the core, but I just wondered
in the light of activism that we're seeing, are there any specific requests, if you like, or strategy pushes that you're
getting from shareholders? I wondered if you could just update us on what you've been hearing, and perhaps
where you're sympathetic to the ideas that are being pushed towards you and maybe where you're pushing back.
And then I had a follow up just on the decline rates. You said that you got higher decline rates on lower spending
in 2021. Having said that, the numbers are only 70,000 barrels a day or about a 2% decline. Can you just help me
understand why that number is so low? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Paul, so on strategy push from shareholders, there's not a lot that's being said in shareholder discussions
that I haven't discussed here. It's what is your strategy for a lower carbon world and where do you see yourself
having unique strengths?
And if there's one thing I do hear back from people, it is support for not going into things where we wouldn't have
competitive differentiation and we may pursue lower return investments just for the sake of saying we're doing it
when there's others out there that can do it just as well. So, beyond that, I'm not hearing a lot of strategy push
from shareholders.
I'll let Pierre take the question on declines.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah. And I'll just add to Mike's comments. This is a sector that is trying to regain favor with investors. It hasn't
earned its cost of capital, and the way out of that isn't by investing more capital; so being disciplined in our
conventional business with capital, being disciplined in M&A, and being disciplined with the energy transition. As
Jeanine asked, renewable energy products operate in commodity markets that have cycles up and down just like
conventional products do.
In terms of our decline, yeah, Paul, I'm not sure – what I had meant to say is that you'll see declines this year
resulting from our capital last year because we did take capital down. But as you rightly point out, the decline –
and we tried to put that on the best apples-to-apples basis, so again, we've got curtailment adjusted and then
asset sales or contract expirations adjusted, which is a good view of our base and our shale and tight. And so it's
a little more than a 2% decline.
It is a big change because that would've been growth previously because you would've had Permian growing.
That was part of the reallocation. Mike showed a chart that said we're likely to invest $40 billion over the last year
and this year. But $13 billion of that was Noble, so no doubt our organic portfolio is not growing like it would have
been previously because we've taken some capital out.
But, as you point out, it's a modest decline. It's because we're facility constrained in a lot of places. We have longlived assets like in Australia LNG and Tengiz and offshore, and even the declines with considered high decline
areas like the Permian, we're able to mitigate. Mike said earlier that our Permian production is beating our
guidance range and will actually be up because of the Noble barrels that we added 2021 versus 2020 full year
and if you adjust for curtailment. So, it's a good story that we're able to be so efficient and mitigate declines, and
I'm happy you picked up on that number.

Q

Hi. Thanks for squeezing me on. One, I would just say thanks for sticking to your guns and only doing things
where you have a competitive advantage. I think that makes clear business sense. Most things have been asked.
I just have one for Pierre. Just on the FX, which has been a headwind to earnings this year, can you talk about
the cash impact that that has, if any, and how you see that potentially playing out in 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, the vast majority of it is non-cash. It's balance sheet translation, so it's taking your monetary accounts,
asset accounts and liability accounts and revaluing it. What we've seen is during the course of the year the dollar
strengthened initially and then we saw it weakening relative to other currencies, in particular, like in Australia,
Canada, some of the others where we'll have like a deferred tax liability that gets revalued.
So it turns into cash over time, but it depends on what the exchange rate is at that time in the future. So you have
modest amounts that happened in the quarter, but the vast majority is reflecting a full revaluation of that liability,
monetary liability or monetary asset account. And how it ultimately settles will decide if those gains or losses are
realized or not in cash flow.

Q

Hey, guys. I just want to ask one question. You are absolutely leading the charge on RNG. And some of the
projects that you're actually developing in RNG have a CI of like minus 150 to minus 200. That's significantly
lower than any EV can actually produce at this point of time. Yet, all we see out there is the demand for EVs and
states saying they only want to run on EVs and manufacturers are saying they only want to make EVs. So is there
something that Chevron and the industry groups can do to educate the governments or the markets that there are
other forms of lower carbon like RNG, which actually have a much significantly lower carbon intensity than an
actual EV?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Manav, I'm impressed. You've done your homework on carbon intensity and not many have to the foundation of
your question. Look, RNG is very good from a carbon standpoint because you mitigate otherwise unmitigated
methane emissions, and that's why it gets the very attractive CI factor. The CI factor has to be worth something
because RNG from a first-cost basis is more expensive than fossil natural gas.
And so, in markets where there's a policy framework that creates that financial connection to the low CI, it's
attractive and economic. And that's where we're playing today. I would expect over time that those policy
frameworks could expand for the reasons that underlie your question. And we are working with customers as well
to help incentivize the adoption of CNG vehicles. We've got an initiative in California where we'll subsidize truck
owners to convert or buy new heavy-duty CNG engines in return for a supply agreement. And then we're working
with a number of different distribution points to enable that to happen.
So we think this is a good part of the mix. It's not the answer everywhere, but it is certainly a part of the mix that
we think deserves to grow, and that's why we've been investing into it. And it ties to the earlier comments about
doing things where we've got unique and competitive advantages.

Q

Hi. Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions actually. One is on, when you think about the portfolio and
also what you've seen in the market through the sort of 2014-2015 volatility, the volatility you're seeing now, are
you starting to change the way you look at the investments that you're making going forward? So, are you looking
at hurdle rates, payback periods, et cetera and changing them to sort of tailor a different environment going
forward?
And also, if you are, are you able to do that through the portfolio or can you also do that through the way you
approach the development of an asset? So you build it with the expectation of adding satellites longer term or you
build a bigger [ph] hose (01:02:28), et cetera. That's the first question. The second, which is slightly tied to that,
and it seems to me also and you've demonstrated it, but low gearing, a low level of indebtedness has served you
very well through those two cycles. So when you think about the sort of three shock absorbers that you have, so
short cycle investment, balance sheet and buybacks, is in the near term the priority getting debt down? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


A

All right. Thanks, Jon. Look, I'll get started. I think the answer to your first question is yes and no. No, we're not
changing how we look at investments. We don't have to go to ancient history books to know that the top line in our
business is volatile. We've had not just 2014-2015, you go 2008-2009, you can go late-1990s, and so to have
companies in our industry that don't have balance sheets that are built for something that we know occurs with
some frequency is a capital structure that doesn't make a lot of sense. It transfers too much risk to equity holders,
and that's partly reflected why the energy sector has underperformed other sectors for a while. So, in that sense, I
don't think we think of it differently.
But to the second part of your first question, can we do developments differently? Absolutely. Can we size them to
keep them full longer offshore? I think Mike has talked about the capital efficiency of our shale and tight, the
flexibility of it. So, undoubtedly, our capital efficiency is better than it ever has been. It means our ability to
generate positive free cash flow from a dollar capital investment. We've talked about being very disciplined with
our capital which reinforces it.
But the basic premise of operating in a set of commodity businesses that are volatile, that hasn't changed in the
last several years. That's been the case for the 30 years I've been with the company. And as you said, I think to
your second part of the question, how we operate with our four financial priorities is it reflects that reality. And so
we understand what business we're in and what kind of capital structure we should have that's in the interest of
our shareholders.

Q

Right. But to that point is, even with an advantaged balance sheet that you have against your peers, I think that's
widely acknowledged, would it be fair to say that the first priority of those sort of three variable things, excepting
that the dividend is a structural thing, is probably balance sheet?

Well, again, our four priorities Mike went through them. It's dividend, reinvestment because we've got to generate
cash for the dividend, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and buybacks is fourth. And so we're already going to
maintain a strong balance sheet. I gave a kind of arrange that we think is a good place to be over the cycle. And
again, we can be below it, heading towards it or above it. So the balance sheet is, well, it's right in the middle of
the range I've been talking about since I've been CFO. So there's no primary need on balance sheet.
What's more – the bigger driver is we're not at a full economic recovery here. And so getting control of the
pandemic, getting the world economies growing again on a sustained path that would be good be good for our
business. Our breakeven is under $50. You can do the math. If oil prices are about $50 and if downstream
margins improved because that's a breakeven under $50 including pretty weak downstream margins, we'll have
excess cash, and we'll look at our priorities and make decisions like we have in the past.
Just as a reminder, we bought back shares 13 out of the last 17 years. We bought back shares on average during
that time period basically equivalent to the daily average. So we're a pretty consistent returner of cash to
shareholders in the form of sustained and growing dividends and share buybacks when we have excess cash.

Operator: We'll take our final question from Ryan Todd at Simmons Energy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan M. Todd
Analyst, Simmons Energy

Q

Great. Thanks, guys. Maybe a couple of quick ones at the end. On disposals moving forward, with the downsized
capital program, should we expect a relatively downsized disposal program on a run rate basis? And if so, is there
a range in terms of what we should think of in terms of annual disposals?
And then maybe as a follow-up question, as we think about your 2021 production guidance, the contract
expirations in Indonesia and Thailand, can you confirm what the volume effect is there? And any willingness to
share what the potential cash flow impact of those volumes would be at $50 oil?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.

Okay. I'll take the asset sale question. I'll let Pierre handle contracts. Yeah, Ryan, first thing is we don't need to
conduct asset sales to generate cash. Other companies might be in a different position. But, look, we've closed
out the program we announced previously. We're not announcing a new program.
Pierre guided to $2 billion to $3 billion for 2021. And if you look back over the last two decades, we've been kind
of plus or minus a couple billion dollars a year in normal portfolio maintenance and kind of rotation. And so I think
that's the kind of a number you ought to think about for your model. And like I said, this coming year, we might be
a little bit to the upside of that. There'll be some years we'd be below that. But we're doing this to high grade and
strengthen our portfolio, not to generate cash.
Pierre, I'll let you take the contracts question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, Ryan, we disclosed in our supplement tables that we provide each quarter, production by country. You see
it in our 10K. So I think it's pretty transparent what production in Indonesia and Thailand is. Not all of Thailand is
part of the concessions that are expiring here early next year. We don't disclose cash flow by country. There's a
fair amount of disclosure in our oil and gas tables that you can look back for there.
So we'll continue to provide what we think is meaningful guidance each quarter as we go forward. We showed the
variance that was tied to contract expiration. So I think all the pieces of the puzzle are there for you, and of
course, if you have follow-up questions, please reach out to Wayne and Roderick.
