Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan [ph] and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to
Chevron's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-andanswer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference
call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron
Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.

Okay. Thank you, Jonathan [ph] .
Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Jeff
Gustavson, General Manager for Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's
website.

Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's first quarter earnings were $4.5 billion
or $2.36 per diluted share. Results are consistent with our earlier guidance where we highlighted specific negative
impacts associated with foreign exchange and selected asset impairments and related charges, which totaled
approximately $500 million for the quarter or $0.26 per share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12
months was 12%. Our debt ratio the end of March was approximately 13%.
Turning to slide 4, cash generated from operations was $8.4 billion during the first quarter. Cash capital
expenditures were $8.5 billion. At quarter end, our cash balances totaled $16.2 billion, giving us a net debt
position of $6.9 billion.
On slide 5, this week Chevron's Board of Directors declared a $1.07 per share quarterly common dividend payable
in mid-June. This represents an 8% annualized payout increase. Since 2004, we have grown the dividend by a
compound annual rate in excess of 10%, which leads the competitor group.
In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the second quarter, we expect to repurchase the
same amount. We are committed to competitive, consistent and growing shareholder distributions. This
demonstrates the importance we place on balancing long-term investor return objectives achieved through
reinvestment in the business, with near-term return objectives achieved through distributions. It also reflects the
strength of our balance sheet, our strong portfolio, and our confidence in the cash generation potential of our
growth projects.
Turning to the next slide, we've incorporated two new slides into the presentation this quarter, which provide
year-on-year comparisons consistent with our earnings press release. The first, shown on slide 6, compares
current quarter earnings with the same period last year.
First quarter 2014 earnings were $4.5 billion, approximately $1.7 billion lower than first quarter 2013 results.
Adverse foreign exchange movements accounted for $325 million, or 20% of the overall decline. You'll recall that
foreign exchange movements for us are largely book translation effects with very little cash flow impacts.
Upstream earnings were down $1.6 billion. In addition to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of about $225
million, the deterioration reflected lower crude oil production and liquids realizations, and higher tax effects,
DD&A and exploration expenses. Downstream results were essentially flat. And the other segment reflected the
impairment of a mining asset, which resulted in an approximate $265 million absolute impact during the quarter
and was offset, to a large degree, by lower corporate expenses.
Turning to slide 7, I'll now compare results for the first quarter 2014 with the fourth quarter of 2013. First quarter
earnings were $418 million lower than fourth quarter results. Upstream earnings were down $545 million, with
adverse foreign exchange movements accounting for two-thirds of this decline. The timing of lifting was the
second significant contributor to upstream's quarter-on-quarter deterioration.
Downstream results increased by $320 million, with nearly equal improvements noted in the U.S. and the
international segments. The current quarter had favorable impacts from lower operating expenses, stronger
chemical results and positive foreign exchange movements, all of which more than offset the adverse volume
effects of a heavier turnaround schedule. The variance in the other bar largely reflects the impairment of a mining
asset partially offset by lower corporate expenses.

Jeff will now take us through the comparisons by segment. Jeff?

Thanks, Pat.
Turning to slide 8, our U.S. upstream earnings for the first quarter were $109 million higher than fourth quarter's
results. Higher realizations increased earnings by $130 million mainly due to the rise in U.S. natural gas prices.
Overall liquids realizations also rose, in large part reflecting crude pricing strength on the West Coast. Lower
production volumes primarily in the Gulf of Mexico reduced earnings by $50 million. The other bar reflects a
number of unrelated items, including the absence of year-end LIFO losses and lower exploration expenses,
partially offset by higher DD&A.
Turning to slide 9, international upstream earnings were $654 million lower than last quarter's results.
Realizations decreased earnings by $50 million consistent with the decline in Brent prices between quarters. The
timing of liftings across multiple countries decreased earnings by $235 million. Year-to-date, we are
approximately 4% underlifted, which, as you know, should reverse in the coming quarters.
Lower exploration expenses increased earnings by $190 million, mainly driven by fewer exploration well writeoffs and overall lower geological and geophysical expenses across multiple locations. An unfavorable swing in
foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $355 million. The first quarter had a loss of about $55 million,
compared to a gain of $300 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
The tax and other bar reflects unfavorable tax effects, many of which were non-income related.
This quarter's results include several non-operational items, namely impairments, which negatively impacted
upstream segment earnings by about $150 million. Adjusting for these effects, our unit earnings for the quarter
would have been approximately $20 per barrel. The reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP earnings can be found in the
appendix of this slide presentation. The upstream segment was also negatively impacted by FX effects and the
timing of liftings, both of which are normally transitory in nature.
Slide 10 summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter
2014 and the fourth quarter 2013. Production increased by 12,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital
projects contributed 21,000 barrels per day, related to higher volumes at Angola LNG and the ramp up associated
with the Papa Terra field offshore Brazil. Shale and tight resources growth contributed 12,000 barrels per day,
driven by production increases from the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian as well as continued
production ramp-up from the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina. The base business and other bar includes the
impact of normal field declines and weather-related disruptions, primarily due to extremely low temperatures in
Kazakhstan, partially offset by lower production downtime related to several assets.
Slide 11 is the second of two new slides incorporated into the presentation this quarter and compares the change
in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter 2014 and the first quarter last year.
Production was 57,000 barrels per day lower than the same period a year ago. Growing volumes from our shale
and tight resources in the Permian and the Marcellus regions in the U.S. and the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina
increased first quarter production by 37,000 barrels per day. Major capital projects contributed 23,000 barrels
per day, driven primarily by production growth from Angola LNG and Papa Terra in Brazil. Production was
impacted by external constraints related to the very cold temperatures in Kazakhstan as well as lower demand in
Thailand due to a lightning strike, which damaged a customer's gas processing plant in the third quarter of 2013.
The base business and other bar includes normal field declines along with other unrelated impacts. Our base
decline rate averaged less than 3% between quarters.
Turning to slide 12. U.S. downstream results increased $157 million between quarters. Planned turnarounds at
our Richmond, California and Pascagoula, Mississippi refineries lowered volumes and decreased earnings by $85
million compared to last quarter. More than offsetting these volume effects were benefits from lower OpEx worth,
$95 million, and stronger chemicals results, worth $80 million. Stronger U.S. chemicals results reflected higher
margins for benzene, olefins and polyolefins from our Chevron-Phillips chemical joint venture. The other bar
reflects a number of unrelated items, primarily higher gains on midstream asset sales partially offset by modestly
lower realized margins particularly on the West Coast, reflecting weak seasonal demand.
Moving to slide 13. International downstream earnings increased $163 million between quarters. Reduced
volumes from turnarounds at our Thailand and South Africa refineries decreased earnings by $75 million during
the quarter. Stronger Asia R&M margins improved earnings by $70 million. Increased demands drove refining
crack spreads higher particularly for low gas and fuel oil. In addition, favorable price lag effects improved
marketing margins. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $85 million, about half of which is related to
fuel costs.
Reduced foreign exchange losses contributed about $70 million to earnings. The first quarter had a loss of $28
million compared to a loss of $96 million in the fourth quarter. The other bar includes a number of unrelated
items including higher chemicals results partially offset by the absence of positive year end LIFO inventory effects
recorded in the fourth quarter.
With that, I'd now like to turn it back to Pat.

Okay, Jeff, thanks.
Turning to slide 14, we hosted our security analyst meeting in early March where we provided a comprehensive
update on the company's performance, projects and future growth prospects. At that time, full information was
not available for some of the competitor comparisons. It is available now, and the segment return on capital
employed updates are shown here.
Our upstream return on capital employed for 2013 was just over 17%. We have led the direct peer group for three
years. In addition, our returns in 2013 were nearly twice the average returns of the larger E&P group, and 3%
higher than the very best company in that group. This speaks to the strength of our portfolio and is especially
impressive considering our current levels of reinvestment, which we expect will generate peer leading volume
growth going forward. Our downstream return on capital employed trended lower in 2013 consistent with the rest
of the industry. We delivered a 10% return and held a number two rank in the peer group, our same position for
the last four years.
Turning to slide 15, an updated information on 2013 upstream cash margins. During 2013, with the $38 per barrel
cash margin we were the best in the peer group by over $10 per barrel. We continued to post the highest
realizations in the peer group. Our oil weighted portfolio is providing us with a lasting relative advantage. We're
also competitive on operating costs and have made sound investment decisions, both of which support our strong
cash margin positions.

Over the past four years, the movement in our cash margin relative to the competition has been remarkable as
shown on the chart on the left. While we've gained $15 per barrel in cash margins, our peers have gained only $8
on average. Importantly, we expect to maintain or even increase our cash margins going forward.
At our Analyst Meeting we used a Brent price of $110 per barrel as the basis for our forward cash flow and
production projections. We have received a number of questions around the selection of the $110 per barrel price
and I want to be clear that this is not an internal price forecast but is simply the actual average Brent price over
the 2011 to 2013 time period. Using prior year's actual pricing is the same methodology we have applied for
several years now in our analyst presentations.
At this historical three-year average Brent price of $110 per barrel our cash margin is expected to increase to over
$40 per barrel later this decade. This is a critical part of our value proposition as the combination of strong
volume growth and an accretive cash margin is expected to drive significant growth in our cash flow from
operations over the next several years.
Turning to slide 16, I'd like to provide a brief progress update on some of our major capital projects and other
growth opportunities. These are laid out across three growth themes, deepwater, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico; LNG, in particular our two large Australian projects; and shale and tight resource areas, most notably the
Permian Basin in the U.S. and the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina.
Starting with the deepwater, as noted last month, the Jack/St. Malo platform was moored in its final location
earlier this year. We continued installation and commissioning activities including final testing of flow lines and
export lines. The project is on budget and is on track for late start-up in the fourth quarter of this year.
For Tubular Bells, which is operated by Hess, hookup and commissioning is nearly 40% complete and start-up is
expected before year-end. We also made significant progress at Big Foot during March. The oil export pipeline has
been installed and we are preparing to lift the drilling module to the topsides later this month. We expect start-up
to occur mid-2015.
Moving on to our LNG projects, we continued to make excellent progress at Gorgon, which is now through April,
80% complete. The final two gas turbine generators have been installed and additional progress has been made on
the LNG tank, jetty and other related infrastructure on the island. All major 2014-milestones are on track and we
expect plant start-ups and first gas in mid-2015.
For Wheatstone, we are now at 33% complete. Progress continues to be made at the plant site, on the Wheatstone
platform and with the offshore development drilling campaign. Wheatstone remains on track to start-up in late
2016.
Gorgon and Wheatstone are critical contributors to our future growth plans and we are pleased with the steady
progress being made on both of these projects. As in prior quarters, we have posted updated photos of both
projects on our investor website. I encourage you to take a look.
We also continued to make progress on our shale and tight resource developments, which nicely complement our
large major capital projects. We have an active drilling and development program in the Permian Basin and we
have drilled over 120 wells so far this year. We continue to focus on capital and execution efficiency as well as the
identification of sweet spots throughout our extensive acreage position in both the Midland and Delaware sub
basins. We are also making steady progress in the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina, progressing this year's
development program. And we recently signed additional agreements for incremental exploration acreage in the
play.
On slide 17, I'd also like to touch on additional progress made elsewhere. We reached final investment decisions
[FID] and received approval from the U.K. government to proceed with the development of the Alder Field in the
Central North Sea. We achieved first production in the Chirag Oil Project in Azerbaijan and acquired new
exploration acreage in Myanmar.
In the downstream we achieved mechanical completion of our new base oil facility in our Pascagoula, Mississippi
refinery. Once fully ramped up this increases our capacity in premium base oils by over 70% making Chevron the
largest premium base oil producer in the world.
In addition, Chevron Phillips Chemical's 1-hexene project as well as Oronite's Singapore expansion project
recently achieved mechanical completion. Lastly, CPChem started construction on its new Gulf Coast
petrochemicals project, which capitalizes on advanced feedstocks sourced from shale gas in North America. This
project is expected to start up in 2017.
Now that concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the
company. We're now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so try to
limit yourself to one question and to one follow up if necessary. We'll do our best to get all of your questions
answered.
Jonathan [ph] , I'd ask that you open up the lines for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.
Your question, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Hey. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Hi, Evan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Hi. Pat, thanks for the comments on the impairment as it clearly affects a clean comparison of your quarterly
upstream profitability. Maybe I missed it. I know your interim update identified $400 million to $500 million of
upstream impairments. In your reconciliation I see $150 million and I thought I heard you mention $265 million.
Can you just talk me through those numbers once again please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A

Sure. The interim update did talk about a total of $400 million to $500 million in additional negative charges and
that included foreign exchange and impairments but we did reference strongly in that total, the mining
component. That mining component is $265 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

And then in the appendix slide that you'll see, there's also $150 million worth of upstream related impairments in
the international segment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Oh, I see. I got you, in the total. Thanks. And I guess my second question, just on net debt increased was it $3.2
billion in the quarter, small working capital increase. I mean I know you intend to bridge to 2015 and beyond
when productive capital begins to drop and cash flow from new projects commences. Yet, where do you see the
debt limit? Is it that AA level at the mid-20s? And then what type of commodity price cushion do you forecast in
crossing that bridge and maintaining current shareholder distributions? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. Evan, I think you referenced there several questions there and you had a couple of really important words in
there. One you talked about bridging. That is an important concept for us. While our free cash flow is essentially
neutral in this particular quarter and you're right, so net debt did increase and that's related to distributions to
shareholders, we're very comfortable with that pattern. It's a pattern that we've had for the last few quarters. It's a
pattern that we could see continuing on here in 2014 and then when we get into 2015 and begin to see these
volumes pick up and the cash flows pick up, then we get into a different state.
We do want to maintain a AA credit rating. We have a lot of room between where our debt level is today at 13%
and what would be necessary to even call that into jeopardy. And by a lot I mean several billion dollars' worth of
additional borrowing capacity. We do test our own plan against a low price environment. And I can tell you that
against the low price environment, even continuing on with the capital program that we have, we are very
comfortable with the distributions that we're making, even in a low price environment and maintaining the AA.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Can you tell us or share what low price means?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

No. I don't want to go that far. I don't want to go that far. So we do look at the overall capital position and financial
position of the firm. We test it against oil prices. And we feel comfortable, Evan, with where we are. The other
thing I would mention is that we do have, you'll recall from the March presentations, we are anticipating asset sale
proceeds of $10 billion over the next three years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio

Q

That's great. Right. I appreciate it. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question
please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ed G. Westlake
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Q

Good morning. And thanks for the extra disclosures in the presentation. Just a question on cash flow. I think after
working capital you said $8 billion, it's been running higher than that. Volumes flattish in the macro environment,
and you shouted out underlifts and some extra tax. But were there any other things that may have contributed to a
slightly lower cash flow this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Nothing of any substantial nature. It was not, I mean with the underlifting circumstance, it was not a particularly
strong U.S. downstream quarter. So I think there are some operational factors that really lead to the $8 billion of
cash generation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ed G. Westlake
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Q

Good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

$8.4 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ed G. Westlake
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Q

Good. Thanks very much. And then Gorgon, you've said 80% complete. You've obviously just had the analyst day
and said mid-2015. Other people, perhaps even partners, are saying perhaps more later in the year, sort of 2016. I
don't want to get into a debate, he said, she said, but what's the critical path that you think in terms of getting
Gorgon up mid-2015? What are the risks that you're now worried about as you get further into the final stages
here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

I think we have 20 of the 21 critical process modules for Train 1 and the infrastructure, the common facilities
infrastructure, on the island. The remaining train is due shortly, will arrive shortly. So it really becomes a process
of the hookup and commissioning. And I think that is, you know, we've just come through kind of a weather
period. So we're moving into good weather. And so I think weather continues to be a risk. And I think labor
productivity continues to be a risk. But both of those, I mean those are aspects of this project that we have been
managing now for four and a half, five years. And so those are clearly on everybody's mind, Ed, in terms of
managing through this. And I want to reiterate that the project's on track. We're aiming for and targeting that
mid-2015 startup.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question
please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul I. Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

Hi. Good morning, Jeff and Pat.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Hey.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul I. Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

If I could kind of a big one and a small one. The big one is you have an interesting number, Pat, which is
unproductive capital. Could you update us on that number and talk a little bit about how you calculate the number
so that we can perhaps use it to compare with other companies? And then the follow-up is on Vaca Muerta. I'll ask
you that in due course. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. Well, basically we just look at – it really is just assets under construction. I mean, definitionally it's assets in
our work in progress account as a percentage of our total capital employed. And the information that we provided
back in March suggested that we were at a pretty high level predominantly because of the LNG projects that we
have underway as well as the couple of Gulf of Mexico deepwater projects. And we indicated that we saw that
stepping down significantly over the next three-year period of time. And I also said verbally, that we saw a pretty
important stair step going from 2013 to 2014 then again to 2015 and 2016. We didn't give actual numbers. I don't
really want to do that, but that pattern that was on our slide back in March is still one that we hold to. So as we see
these projects come online, they move out of that WIP account, that work in progress account, into a producing
asset account.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul I. Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

My recollection was that there was an actual number of unproductive capital. I guess you could update us on
capital employed, or at least the last available number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, year-end capital employed was about $171 billion.

Q

Paul I. Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

And – right. So the information that we gave on the slide was a three-year average there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul I. Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

Okay, and what was the unproductive number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

A

So, Paul, the three-year average, 2011 to 2013 was in the low 40% range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

A

Moving down to the mid 30%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

30% range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

A

For 2014 to 2016, but that's the average 2014 through 2016. As Pat said, it steps down in each of those years. Our
historic average here is maybe the high 20s.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul I. Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

Yeah, that's right. So it was percentages, as I recall now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

It was percentages. And we used the averages. You should – I think it's fair to say that 2011 was the lowest of the
three years. 2012 was the middle of the three years, and 2013 was the highest of the three years. But the three-year
average there was at low-40s. And then what we're saying is, 2014, 2015 and 2016 will reverse that pattern.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Paul I. Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Yeah, understood. Okay. That's helpful on that calculation. And then Vaca Muerta, can you do a little bit more to
strip-out Argentina? You've kind of bundled it with Permian.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Paul I. Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

And the extent to which that's acquisition growth as opposed to organic growth? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, well, so I think that in terms of the Vaca Muerta play itself, we're continuing to make progress there. Our
plan is to drill about 140 wells this year. We've got about 17, 18 or 19 rigs drilling at this particular point in time,
and production there on a gross basis is about 17,000 barrels a day. We're encouraged by the well results, both on
costs and productivity. But there's still – it's early days there. There's still a long way to go, but we're encouraged
so far.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Paul I. Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Okay. I think I'll take it offline on the breakout in terms of volumes year-over-year. It's just, I was saying that on
the variance you've bundled Vaca with Permian.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Oh, I see. I misunderstood the question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Paul I. Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

No, no. Thanks for the answer, absolutely. That was just the follow up, really.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

A

So year-over-year, Paul, we hadn't booked production in the first quarter of last year. We just, we started booking
production in the fourth quarter, so there is a contribution fourth quarter to first quarter. But over quarters, it is
acquisition-related. But if you want to talk more specifically about it, just talk to me offline.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul I. Sankey
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Okay. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill

Q

Thanks. Good morning, Jeff and Pat. I've got also the one big and one small one if that's okay. On the impairments
part, is that the reason for the high DD&A number, and if so, can you give us an idea what the run rate should be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

It certainly is a contributor to the high DD&A rates. Absolutely, that's a factor. And in terms of general DD&A, I
think that it's fair to say that overall corporate DD&A is going to go forward, move up. Our expectation would be
that it would move up in 2014 relative to 2013. And we see upstream DD&A per barrel rising for the next couple of
years, but then flattening out over time. The pattern on both the absolute and the per barrel is something that you
would absolutely expect because of recent investments and our future investments. It obviously is also impacted
by reserve add timing and the mix of our projects, et cetera.
Our PPC, our pre-productive capital, as we talked about, is going to come down. I think the thing you've got to
keep in mind here too is, that for this investment that is evidencing itself and will evidence itself in our DD&A
rate. We are giving the investment audience the largest growth rate of the peer group, a 20% growth rate in
volumes between now and 2017. So significant investment will generate a significant volume growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Leggate
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Q

All right. Thanks, Pat. I'll take the specifics on DD&A offline with Jeff if that's okay. But I – my follow-up is really
your last point because, I think the growth in the cash margins are actually fairly well understood. What –
certainly we've observed over the years is that, that really gets paid by the market when it's accompanied by strong
debt-adjusted growth if you like, so the balance sheet's not expanding at the same time. So I'm just kind of
curious, when you look at your – you say you're delivering the best 20% growth. How do you think about the
tradeoff that's a $10 billion annual run rate on the balance sheet? I'll leave it there. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

So – I mean, I guess I think that if you've got the project queue, a strong project queue and you've got a balance
sheet that allows you to invest for that, and we do have a balance sheet – in fact you could really argue that for
years we were underlevered relative to what might be optimal. So if you've got the strong project queue and if
you've got the balance sheet to support it and the projects are value-accreting for the organization, for the firm,
then I think that's exactly the kind of investment profile you ought to be undertaking.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng

Q

Hey, guys. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Hey, Paul.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Pat, don't know what the – if you want to answer that, I think a lot of people is asking that for CPC, your joint
venture, strategically is there any particular reason you need to own it – that so that you can have synergy with
your other operations? If not, if you look at it as a financial investment, does it make sense for you to own a
minority interest and put it up as a publicly-traded entity together with your partner Phillips 66 and put it into the
market so that you can recognize a much higher value, given where you've now been trading at a higher multiple
than, say, both your partner and yourself?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, so I understand the question there. And I'll just start back with, when we put the two companies together we
had two, I guess I would say, sort of middling-performing chemical companies. We put them together and it's
been a wonderful marriage. The partners are very much aligned on how to run this business, where do you extract
value from this business. And so it's a joint venture that has worked very well and has been very successful so
we're very pleased, so there's no catalyst that's out there necessarily to say that we need to be doing something
different.
It is a part of the portfolio that has growth opportunities available to it. It's – and we appreciate that with this
change in the U.S. gas production and advantaged feed stock opportunities here. I think CPChem calls on the
technical expertise of both of its parent companies, and we're able to and happy to assist them in that capacity. We
think it fits nicely in our portfolio. It has – the chemical business is highly, highly cyclical, more so than our
portfolio. And so it's, we're able to withstand the adjustments that are there, that we think that's an advantage as
well.
So we don't really see that there's huge – there's a huge catalyst for us to do something different. And it's not
always clear that the P/E multiples in these petrochemical commodity companies are always trading at multiples
better than ours.
So we like the joint venture, we think it's well-run, we're happy to assist in its growth projects and providing
expertise and technical capability where we can. We're very satisfied with it, and I dare say that our joint venture
partner would be feeling much the same.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Okay. Very good. Second question. Can you give us a quick update whether Angola LNG right now is running at
50% capacity? And also in the Permian with the 25 rigs, do you have a number that – how many of them is
currently running in the unconventional?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. Let me start...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

And whether they are in pad drilling already? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. Let me start with Angola and then we might need to – you might need to help me again on the second
question.
So on Angola, we did have recently a technical issue pop up. We had a piping failure, which did result in an
unplanned interruption to production. There was no fire. There were no injuries. It was a pretty localized damage.
It was associated with the flare system. We are doing a root cause investigation. And in fact that root cause
analysis should be completed within a few days here is my understanding.
So the plant is currently shut down and we'll need to take look at that root cause analysis to understand what the
go forward operating plan looks like. That failure occurred sort of mid-April, early April and it therefore was not
an impact in the first quarter results.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Permian, the 25 rigs, how many of them is in unconventional drilling and of which, how many of them is in the
pad drilling already?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. So all of the 25 rigs in the Permian right now are in the unconventional. We have only one rig drilling in the
conventional. And I think you're asking about pad drilling?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

That's correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

I don't have information on that specific at this point, Paul.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Reid from Bank of Montreal. Your question,
please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Iain S. Reid
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Ltd.

Q

Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks very much. Pat, sorry about this but can I get back to the impairments and assets
divestments you put in the reconciliation at the back? I didn't understand some of the stuff you were talking about
earlier. You've got $150 million of E&P impairments it looks like in the first quarter and also $100 million gain on
dispositions then you've also got this mining write down as well. Can you just put those together for me again?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Sure. So let's start with the biggest element, which is the mining element. We have a molybdenum mine in New
Mexico and the impairment charges that we talked about there and other related charges that I talked to at the
very beginning, the $265 million relates to that, that asset from a segmented reporting basis is in our other
segment.
In upstream, we noted $150 million of impairments. It's in the international sector for us. So these are assets
where we feel there is better opportunity in other portfolios, basically.
And then the third element that was noted there was a asset sale gain. This was in our midstream, "midstream
sector". It's really pipeline related and that showed up in the downstream external segment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Iain S. Reid
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Ltd.

Q

Okay. Thanks very much. And the second thing was, is it possible to update us on when we're likely to see the
Tengiz future growth FID?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Our target is for this year, our target is to have that towards the end of the year. I don't really have any additional
information at this point. We were successful in getting the MOU assigned back in the latter part of last year,
which really is the stage setting document to get all the partners aligned on the go-forward process. And so we're
in the process now of going through and working the cost estimates, et cetera, et cetera. So all I can say is towards
the end of this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Iain S. Reid
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Ltd.

Q

And we should expect the kind of overall CapEx for this – gross CapEx for this project along the lines of some of
your major things you're doing in Australia? Is that correct or is that kind of ballpark right sort of number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

I'm sorry. So TCO is Kazakhstan, right? I guess one last thing there on TCO, the FID is not kind of critical path.
What was the question on Australia? I didn't quite understand.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Iain S. Reid
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Ltd.

Sorry. I just want to get an overall ballpark idea of what the overall cost estimate of the future growth project is
going to be. Is it in the same ballpark as what you're doing in Australia?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

I see, Iain. We don't have an updated – we don't have a cost estimate. We won't have a cost estimate until we go to
FID. So that will be later and attached to the FID timing.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your question,
please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Faisel H. Khan
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)

Thanks. Good morning. First question on Jack/St. Malo, you said it was moored in location. I just want to
understand a little bit, how much sort of wiggle room do you guys have from now until the start up to get that
project going? Meaning if there is an active hurricane season, have you built in that sort of weather into the startup at the end of the year for that project?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Well, it's my understanding that when we're putting these facilities out in the Gulf of Mexico, we do as much
weatherproofing as we possibly can. Obviously, when you're investing at the size of these facilities, that's an
important consideration. So clearly, having it moored is an important step. And so our expectation is that we
would be able to handle any weather complications that might arise.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Faisel H. Khan
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)

Okay. Fair enough.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

I'd just add, Faisel, if there are hurricanes, you have to demobilize the folks that are working on it. That could slow
things down a little bit. But we don't – it's hard to estimate what's going to happen there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Faisel H. Khan
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)

I guess I'm trying to understand if you guys have sort of incorporated that into your guidance of the start-up.
A

In a general sense, from a planning standpoint we always do factor in Gulf of Mexico weather activities to a
degree, right? But each year is a different degree, if you know what I mean.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Faisel H. Khan
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)

Q

Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

So there's obviously a base load that we include in our plans, yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Faisel H. Khan
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)

Q

Okay. That's fair. I understand. And then just on the underlift you guys talked about the sequential quarter-overquarter change of $235 million. Is that also fair to say that that's the absolute number, too?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeff Gustavson
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

A

I'll give you the absolute for the quarter is about $100 million, about half of that. So the rest of that is swing
between the two quarters, Faisel.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Faisel H. Khan

Q

All right, Jeff. Thanks. I appreciate the detail.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James your
question, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pavel S. Molchanov
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Q

Thanks for taking the question. You're obviously talking a lot more proactively about the Permian. Presumably
you'd like to get more value for that asset. Have you considered any kind of financial engineering solution that
might unlock that value more so than simply as one piece of your U.S. portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, we think we actually, Pavel, are sitting kind of in the catbird seat in terms of the acreage position that we've
got, the long standing acreage position we've got, the royalty advantage that we have there.
We have done joint ventures of a kind with, for example, Cimarex, where we have partnered with similarly
situated partners. And those kinds of things you could see us continuing to do on a go-forward basis if you get
commonality of infrastructure and location and you can get efficiencies of drilling where your fracking can really
go from our property to their property. So we will continue to look for those opportunities for synergies.


We've got a very active program scheduled for this year, over 500 wells and 25 rigs. We've done 120 drilling so far.
So the activity level is at or perhaps even a little bit better than planned at this point. So we'll continue to look for
opportunities like that but we're proceeding ahead on our own as well.

question, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Guy A. Baber
Analyst, Simmons & Co. International

Q

Thank you all for taking my question. My first one was on the 2014 production guidance. Understanding it's still
very early in the year, I just wanted to get a sense of how confident you guys are in the guidance right now? Is this
considering some of the weather influence that you battled in 1Q, the unplanned downtime at Angola LNG and
then 2Q and 3Q typically being heavier maintenance quarters? I just wanted to better understand how you guys
are feeling about that internally and any cushion you might have built into the guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Okay. That's a good question. I guess I would just start by saying the year is young. We've only had three months
in here. There have been some positives. Jeff mentioned a figure about base business decline being at the 3%, or a
little bit less than 3% level, so that's very good positive.
One thing we haven't mentioned that's of a positive nature is at Frade. We now have 10 producing wells on, and
we continue to make progress to bring on additional wells there.
We've talked about the Permian ramp-up and the Vaca Muerta ramp-ups that are occurring. So those are all
working in our favor. Clearly weather has been a negative for us in the first quarter. On an absolute basis we'd
estimate that, that was worth 20,000 barrels a day or so, absolutely negative in the quarter. I mentioned the
ALNG operational issues that we have there. So we put those all together, you've got some pluses, you've got some
minuses. In the back end of the year we've got Tubular Bells and Jack/St. Malo both of which are scheduled to
come online. So our production ramp-ups are kind of backend loaded, and both of those projects are on track.
So the best I can say is, and that's – I'll go back and say, we build in weather contingencies in our Gulf of Mexico
plan in particular, for a base load amount. I'll just go back and say, the year is young. We've got positives and
negatives out there. We feel that the guidance that we gave, the 2,610, is the best guidance that we have at this
particular point in time. And as we do every year in the second quarter, we'll update you with how things look at
that point in time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Guy A. Baber
Analyst, Simmons & Co. International

Okay, great. Thanks for that. That was very helpful. Then my follow-up was on one of your three primary growth
beams, the deepwater. And I'm more focused on your next generation of projects looking beyond the near term
start-ups that you have lined up. As we start thinking about potential reserve additions, and then longer term
growth potential. But you all have a number of potential FIDs this year that you have an interest in. I think,
Stampede and then your Indonesia development at Bonga, and then you're also re-evaluating Rosebank.
So understanding that every project is unique, I was just hoping you could provide some more commentary on
just how conducive the overall environment right now is to pushing forward deepwater FIDs, just in light of your
view of the cost environment and the evolution of project economics, and what you might see as the opportunity
for cost savings. Just given what generally appears to be a more disciplined approach to screening these projects
for you all and with some of your peers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

Okay. Well, I think I would say, if I step back and look at deepwater, I think for Chevron's portfolio, you
mentioned a number of projects, but I think the most strategic basin continues to be the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. And
we've got a number of wells drilling now and will have additional wells drilling over the next 12 to 18 months, a
significant number of them. Six wells in the next 12 to 18 months. So that continues to be an area of strategic
focus. And we think we're competitive there on facility structure as well as drilling costs, completion costs. So
that's an important area for us.
If I look at IDD, IDD is a – it's a complex project. It's multiple fields, and right now we're in the position of waiting
for government approvals.
And then on Rosebank, we did – with the operator, kind of put that – as the operator, put that into a recycle
mode. Because the costs that had come through were really – didn't make it compete for capital within our
portfolio. So that's somewhat in a recycle mode.
So I think the overall impression that you have about the industry, stepping back and taking a look at the cost runup in some of these – for some of these resource plays relative to the value capture, I think some of that is being
re-assessed, as you indicate. Rosebank is a good example of that.

Q

Good morning.

A

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

I guess to come back to the Permian a little bit. If I understood correctly, you're not, or have not to this point,
drilled any horizontal wells in the Midland Basin? Was that accurate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

We are looking to spud the first one later on this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

Okay. So thinking about how production from the horizontal wells has typically been a little more, let's say, higher
IP rates and leave it at that. We should think about the shale and tight production accelerating, I don't know, call
it Q4 or certainly into 2015. Would that be consistent with how you're looking at things?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

So I think it would be fair to say that, if you go forward and you look at quarter after quarter after quarter
improvement, we would be looking to see improvements kind of quarter after quarter. Our real focus has been on
getting capital efficiency maximized and getting a strong execution efficiency as well, so it's really been on
optimizing the value creation. And so we've been spending time to understand where the best areas are and what
the most efficient rig, pad and overall development plan is.
Frankly, a lot of the other producers there have been allowing us to de-risk this play by the work that they have
done. And that's in a sense advantageous to us. And we think we can get over time the same kind of synergies and
efficiencies that the smaller operators have.
And one of the slides that we had put out in the Security Analyst Meeting gave a good indication of what we see as
year-on-year net production increases in the Permian Basin. And it's a pretty significant growth rate. We also
talked to essentially a doubling of our rig count over the next several years from where it is currently.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

Right. Well, it's I guess we now have a couple quarters here where you're breaking out shale and tight from
everything else so we can start to get a feel for what that quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year performance is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Exactly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

And where we'll go for quarter on quarter improvement going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Roger D. Read
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q

Good. I guess my follow-up question, the Angola LNG obviously going to be offline in terms of volume
contribution in the second quarter for some significant period of time. But if you think about – and I know
sometimes you don't want to get too granular but the impact on it from a cash flow standpoint, I mean was this
operation, given the troubles it's had so far, actually contributing much? Or should we think about it as mostly a
production impact but not a problem for cash flows as we look in the next couple of quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.

A

Yeah, I think you will see – it will be more noticeable clearly in the production side than the cash flow side clearly.
And I don't have, as I mentioned, we need to have the root cause analysis done before we have an indication of
when – what that repair and maintenance – repair activity will look like and how long that will take and then
when we might get back to producing mode.
