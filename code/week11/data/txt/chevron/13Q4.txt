Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome toChevron's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen -only mode.After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at thattime. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr.John Watson. Please go ahead.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome to everyone to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast.On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Gustavson, who is our GeneralManager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before get started,please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward -looking statements.We ask that you review the detailed cautionary statement on slide 2.Turning to slide 3, I want to begin by highlighting some of our strategic accomplishments for the year. We had ourlowest ever days away from work rate continuing our improvement over several years now. We've been theindustry leader on this metric since 2010. Our financial performance in 2013 was solid. Once competition resultsare fully analyzed, we expect to once again post the highest upstream cash and earnings margins per barrelcompared to a broad set of peer competitor s. Our strong cash flows and balance sheet allowed us to fund ourcapital program and capture new resource opportunities while maintaining competitive shareholder distributions.In our downstream business, we started commercial operations of a 53,000 barr el per day vacuum gas oil FCCunit at the 50% owned Yeosu refinery in South Korea. We made significant progress on the construction of a25,000 barrel per day premium base-oil plant at the Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery here in the U.S. We expect toreach mechanical completions towards the end of the first quarter and will then ramp up to full capacity duringthe second quarter. In addition, we've also advanced our Oronite expansion project in Singapore. Our CPChemaffiliate, our 50% owned chemicals joint venture announced final investment decision on a $6 billion U.S. GulfCoast petrochemical project.In our upstream business, we achieved startup and first shipment from Angola LNG. Production began at thePapa-Terra project in Brazil. We also started up North Rankin 2 in Australia which maintains production capacityat the North West Shelf LNG project. We made substantial progress on our major capital projects. At the end ofJanuary, Gorgon is currently about 7 6% complete while Wheatstone is about 27% complete. Similar to priorquarters we have posted a number of photos highlighting our construction projects on these two importantfacilities on our Chevron Investor webpage located at chevron.com.We also continued construction activities for our projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The Jack/St. Malo hullhas now moored at its offshore location and is on schedule for startup later this year. Big Foot is expected to betowed to location in the third quarter with the expected startup next year. We reache d final investment decisionfor the Alder developments in the U.K. North Sea as well as for Moho Nord in the Republic of the Congo.We had a very busy year from a resource capture standpoint, successfully acquiring an interest in a discoveredresource opportunity in Argentina to develop and explore the Vaca Muerta Shale, and we also closed on our entryinto the Kitimat LNG project in Western Canada where the resources will come from new positions in the HornRiver and Liard basins. We acquired additional shale and tight resource acreage in the Cooper Basin in Australiaand the Duvernay Basin in Canada, the Permian Basin in the U.S., as well as in the Ukraine. We also grew ourexploration portfolio by acquiring positions in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Australia, Brazil, Morocco and in thedeepwater Gulf of Mexico. Our one-year reserve replacement was 85%, bringing our three-year replacement ratioto 123%. We're proud of our performance this past year.And with that, I'll turn it over to Pat, who will take you through the financial results. Pat?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp.Okay. Thank you, John. Slide 4 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarterearnings were $4.9 billion or $2.57 per diluted share. For the year, earnings were $21.4 billion. This equates to$11.09 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the year was 13.5%, and our debt ratio at year -end was12%.2013 marked our 26th consecutive annual div idend increase with an 11% growth in the quarterly rate. Thisdemonstrates our confidence in our future performance and is consistent with our priority of rewardingshareholders with sustained and strong dividend growth. In the fourth quarter, we repurchas ed $1.25 billion ofour shares, bringing the full year share repurchase total to $5 billion. In the first quarter of 2014, we expect torepurchase the same amount. Finally, Chevron's 2013 total shareholder return was 19.2%. We continue to lead ourpeer group on total shareholder returns for the three-year, five-year and 10-year period.
Turning to slide 5, cash generated from operations was $10.5 billion during the fourth quarter. This was thestrongest cash generation quarter of the year. For the full year , cash from operations totaled $35 billion, reflectingthe continued cash generating strength of our portfolio. Cash capital expenditures were $11.6 billion during thequarter and $38 billion for the full year. We had a very successful year on our resource acquisition efforts, as Johnjust mentioned. At year end, our cash balances totaled $16.5 billion, giving us a net debt position of $4 billion. Thecompany continues to move towards a more traditional capital structure.Turning to slide 6, I'll compare results for the fourth quarter 2013 with the third quarter 2013. As a reminder, ourearnings release compares fourth quarter 2013 with the same quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter earnings were$4.9 billion, $20 million lower than the third quarter results. Upstream earnings were down $240 million,reflecting lower liquids realizations and higher exploration and operating expenses. Partially offsetting werefavorable foreign exchange movements of $490 million. Downstream results edged up $10 million betweenquarters. Higher margins and favorable inventory effects were mostly offset by the absence of gains on assettransactions and higher operating expenses. The variance in the other bar largely reflects a favorable swing incorporate tax items during the quarter.On slide 7 , our U.S. upstream earnings for the fourth quarter were $223 million lower than third quarter's results.Lower realizations decreased earnings by $165 million, consistent with the decline in U.S. crude oil priceindicators. Lower production volumes reduced earnings by $35 million, mainly due to planned maintenanceactivity in the Gulf of Mexico and cold weather disruptions in the Mid-Continent region. The other bar reflects anumber of unrelated items, including higher operating expenses and unfavorable tax impacts, partially offset bylower exploration and DD&A expenses.Turning to slide 8, international upstream results were just $17 million lower than last quarter's results.Realizations decreased earnings by $60 million consistent with the decline in Brent prices between quarters.Higher exploration expenses, mainly driven by the write -off of an exploration well offshore Canada, and highergeological and geophysical expenses across multiple areas decreased earnings by $190 million. A combination ofhigher operating expenses and DD&A lowered earnings $150 million between periods. The other bar reflects anumber of unrelated items, including the absence of asset sale gains and favorable tax effects from the priorquarter.A favorable swing in foreign currency effects increased earnings by $490 million. The fourth quarter had a gain ofabout $300 million compared to a loss of about $190 million in the third quarter.Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Productiondeclined 9,000 barrels a day between quarters. Our shale and tight assets contributed 7,000 barrels a day, mainlyfrom new production in the Marcellus region in the U.S. and Vaca Muerta in Argentina. External constraintslowered fourth quarter production by 12,000 barrels a day, reflecting lower demand in Thailand and inBangladesh as well as weather-related disruptions in the U.S. The base business and other bar include the impactof normal field declines, which are partially offset by higher production from Agbami in Nigeria.Slide 10 compares full year 2013 net oil equivalent production to that of 2012. Production declined by 13,000barrels per day in 2013. Production averaged 2.6 million barrels per day for the year, 98% of our originalguidance. This was driven primarily by the slower ramp-up at Angola LNG, more expensive turnaround activities,and lower gas demand than anticipated in several countries. Base business declines and asset sales reducedproduction by 49,000 barrels per day between years. Our base business operations delivered strong performancefor 2013. Our base decline rate was lower than our target of 4%, providing significant barrels and value.Growing volumes from our shale and tight resources in the Permian and in the Marcellus regions in the U.S.contributed 25,000 barrels per day. Our shale and tight production grew more than 15% in 2013. Incrementalproduction from our major capital projects contributed 11,000 barrels per day, driven by the Angola LNG startup,first oil from Papa-Terra in Brazil, and the ramp-up of production at the Usan field in Nigeria.Turning now to slide 11, U.S. downstream results were up $16 million between periods. Stronger marginsincreased earnings by $95 million mainly due to lower crude costs. West Coast refining margins also benefitedfrom the completion of planned maintenance activity in the third quarter at our El Segundo, California refinery.Gains on asset sales contributed about $90 million less in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. The other barreflects a number of unrelated items of smaller impact.On slide 12, international downstream earnings were nearly flat between quarters. Margins improved earnings by$20 million. Higher refining margins in Canada on lower crude costs and improved marketing margins inAustralia were partially offset by lower refining margins in Asia where we have seen weaker demand and amplesupply. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $60 million principally from maintenance, repairs andtransportation. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items including favorable year -end LIFO impactspartially offset by lower trading results and an unfavorable swing in foreign exchange impacts.Slide 13 covers all other. Fourth quarter net charges were $312 million compared to $522 million in the thirdquarter, a decrease of $210 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $162million benefit to earnings, while corporate costs were $48 million lower this quarter. For the full year, thissegment had net charges of $1.6 billion, putting us in the lower end of our $400 million to $500 million guidancerange per quarter. We believe this quarterly guidance range for the all other segment is still appropriate goingforward.With that, I'm going to turn it back over to John for a few comments on 2014. John?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp.Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide 14, in December, you'll recall we announced a $39.8 billion capital program for2014, $2 billion lower than 2013. We expect 2013 to be a relative peak spending year, and 2014 to represent thepeak year for LNG spend as our two Australian LNG projects move closer to production. This program alsosupports our large deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments as well as ongoing development and ramp -upactivities in the Permian Basin in the U.S. We're also investing in longer-term projects in Kazakhstan, Canada andWest Africa, which will drive profitable growth for many years.Importantly, planned spending is directed towards our profitable base business assets throughout the world aswell. This includes significant activity across several producing regions in North America as well as in Thailandand Indonesia, amongst others. Our downstream investments for 2014 are geared toward enhancing reliabilityand energy efficiency, feedstock flexibility and the production of cleaner transportation fuels. We are also fundingmajor capital projects related to our chemicals business. Our Oronite expansion project in Singapore is planned tostart up in 2014 and will begin ramping up construction activities on the U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project,which recently reached FID and is planned to start up in 2017 . We have an attractive portfolio of investmentopportunities which we'll continue to fund in a disciplined fashion to grow enterprise value and fund shareholderdistributions.On slide 15, our net production outlook for 2014 is 2.61 million barrels oil equivalent per day based on an averageBrent price of $109 per barrel which was the same average price as 2013. This outlook does not assume OPECcurtailments, materials and security or other market impacts. Our full year estimate for 2014 includes modestproduction ramp-ups at Angola LNG, Papa-Terra and in the Permian Basin. These are expected to be partiallyoffset by declines from our base producing assets where we continue to assume an average decline rate ofapproximately 4%. Our focus is on managing the decline rate related to our base business, which is performingvery well, and on executing with excellence those developments which are expected to add material productionvolumes in the years ahead.Our long-term production growth outlook is compelling, profitable and will add value. It is driven by five largeprojects, Angola LNG, Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot, Gorgon and Wheatstone, which in total will add over 500,000barrels per day of net new production to Chevron at full capacity. In 2015, we'll see the startup of Gorgon and BigFoot and additional ramp-up of Jack/St. Malo. We look forward to providing more details on our key projects andproduction outlook at our upcoming Security Analyst Meeting.Thank you. That concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest inthe company. We're ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please limityourself to one question and one follow-up, if necessary. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered.Jonathan, please open the line for questions.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTIONOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from ISIGroup. Your question, please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug T. TerresonAnalyst, International Strategy & Investment Group LLC QGood morning, everybody.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AHey, Doug.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AGood morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug T. TerresonAnalyst, International Strategy & Investment Group LLC QMy question is about capital discipline and specifically the decline in returns on capital to around 14%, which Ithink places that result at its lowest level in many years. And on this point, John, you talked about the importanceof value creation and you always do, actually, but also making hard choices in capital allocation when you were inNew York recently. And so while I recognize that you have to complete investment in these mega-projects, Iwanted to see what the company's doing to address this issue from a corporate planning perspective or whateveryou deem relevant to ensure that this value creation process is optimized?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. ASure. Good question, Doug.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug T. TerresonAnalyst, International Strategy & Investment Group LLC QThanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AWell, certainly, did announce capital program as I said of $39.8 billion. It's a significant program and it largelyreflects the good Q that we have. When I reflect on our company and our capital discipline, you know we have awide lead in profit per barrel, some $5 a barrel not just over the majors, but over independents and others. So wehave had discipline over the years and the projects that we have in the queue, we think, will also add to earningsgoing forward.Now, it's true that the cycle time for some of the projects that I mentioned, those big five that I mentioned, is long.And so there is capital that is not yet on production in the queue. Notwithstanding that, we actually expect ourupstream business to have the second-highest return on capital employed this year despite that high level of pre -productive capital. So I think we've got good discipline on these projects. We've got a good record of doing it.Now, inside the company, we're cognizant that there has been a significant increase in the cost of goods andservices across the industry. Since the middle of last decade, costs have more than doubled and there are somehotspots around the world. So we're looking very closely at the projects that are in our portfolio. Naturally, we'regoing to continue with the projects that are under construction. But you've seen a couple of areas where we havemade some choices, the Rosebank project in the North Sea. We think that's a good project, a good resource, butcosts came in at just higher than what we felt were appropriate. So we're taking a hard look at that project,reviewing it, seeing if we can make the economics more attractive, the Vietnam gas project. We've worked – weand frankly, Unocal before us worked for more than a decade to try to make that project a success. Haven't beenable to do that just yet.So I think that we're really doing what we can. I'd tell you, also in the U.S., we've scaled back our spending on gasas you might expect. So the volume that you'll see from gas in the U.S. will be less than we might have planned afew years ago. The only area where we're spending on gas in any appreciable amount is in the Marcellus where wehave a carry that enables us to continue to spend. So all of those things plus outreach that our employees aremaking with vendors and contractors, and frankly, just belt-tightening in general which is a big focus for us rightnow and will be a message that I'll be sending in my worldwide conference call with employees in a couple ofweeks, are the kinds of things that we're working on.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug T. TerresonAnalyst, International Strategy & Investment Group LLC QOkay. Those are all great points. And so let me just ask one more. So have you guys quantified what your level ofpre-productive capital is, however, you guys define and how that compares to normal today, John?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AWe do and I'll make you a promise that Pat Yarrington will show you a fair amount of information on that whenwe come back in March. But it – Doug, it's at a high level right now.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug T. TerresonAnalyst, International Strategy & Investment Group LLC QSure. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AOkay.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America MerrillLynch. Your question, please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch QThanks. Good morning, guys. If I could take one and my follow-up, please. Adoption outlook 20...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AI can't hear you, Doug.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. ADoug, you've cut out.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch QHi. Can you hear me now?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AIf you speak up.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch QYeah, I'll try and speak up. Sorry. So, John, your production trajectory for 2014, I think, has taken some folks bysurprise in terms of the fact that it's basically flat year -over-year. Has something slipped or changed there, or areStreet expectations just wrong? Or can you basically give us an idea when you expect the inflection point inproduction? And I've got a follow-up, please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. ASure. As I indicated, our production guidance for 2014 is 2.61 million barrels, and really we – there's a couplethings to talk about. One, our base business has been performing very well. So we're continuing to invest in thebase and frankly we've seen some declines that are less than we would expect. But we do use our standard 4%decline estimate for the base business, the underlying business for 2014. Beyond that, it's a function of ramp-upsthat we have on major capital projects and there are really a couple that fall into that category. One is Angola LNGand the other is Papa-Terra in Brazil that Petrobras operates. We've got a couple wells on in Papa -Terra but it's –the ramp-up takes place. It's really a two-part project that will take place over the course of this year and we takeoperator guidance in setting that estimate.Angola LNG ramp-up is less than we would have expected a couple of years ago, and this might be a good time forme to talk about that project. Our share of production from Angola LNG is 60,000 barrels a day net at fullcapacity. We've had about five cargos last year, I think we've had a couple that we've lifted this year, but we'vebeen working on some technical issues on the front end of the plant with the dehydration unit. Remember, this isan associated gas project, meaning there's variable feed coming from different facilities. We've had some technicalissues on the front end of that plant, and so our expectation is it will not ramp up to full capacity this year. It willlikely be more like 30,000 barrels a day if we run at about half capacity this year with the full fix in the first part of2015 and then ramp up to full capacity after that. So that is probably one of the factors that might be influencingthe estimates that are out there.Beyond that, we've got Jack/St. Malo which we're very pleased with which will be starting up late in the year.Obviously, you only get a partial year's production from a – later in the year start up, but that will start up nicely.So I think it's more likely that the inflection point will come next year than this year. I don't think that'sinconsistent with the guidance that we gave if you go back to 2010 in the sense that we said that we would growroughly 1% between 2010 and 2014, and then 4% to 5% a year thereafter ramping up to our larger targets. So –but understanding the performance of LNG has impacted 2014 to be sure.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch QGreat. Thanks for the answer, John. My follow-up very quickly to Pat is a move to a normal balance sheetstructure, Pat. It looks to us that your cash burn is about $10 billion a year. Is it realistic that you add $30 billionby the – to your balance sheet by the time you hit your targets in 2017 ? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AYeah, Doug, that will all be a function really of what realizations or what 's happening from the crude marketstandpoint fundamentally. But if you assume no significant change from where we are today, from a realizationstandpoint and acknowledge what the production growth will look like and what cash from operations could looklike, it's – we would expect to add additional borrowings to our balance sheet of reasonable size over the nextcouple of years. So we're starting with a very low leverage rate, 12% right now and there's a lot of capacity that wecan utilize to not only fund the business activity, reinvest in the business, but also continue on with strongshareholder distributions.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. ALet me offer a couple of other comments, if I could on that one. Our cash C&E this year in 2000 – this last year in2013 was about $39 billion. That included some acquisitions. We expect fewer this year. And the cash spend isabout $35 billion this year. In addition, asset sales were relatively low last year. We expect modestly higher assetsales going forward. We're doing some rationalizing in the midstream business, part of the ordinary course ofbusiness and we have a few things we're looking at in the upstream portfolio.Remember, most of the cash drain you're referring to is planned, orderly, to restore our balance sheet back to amore leveraged structure, and is largely a function of share repurchases that we're putting in place. Our intentionis we get to – as we start ramping up production, of course, is to get to a point where we not only cover C&E butalso cover the dividend. Our policy on dividend has been to grow that dividend commensurate with the ongoingpattern of earnings and cash flow over the long-term. So we're in this period where we have relatively high spend,we're generating good cash but we expect cash generation to increase. And as we go forward, we expect the cashconsumption to attenuate as we roll into higher levels of production.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Doug LeggateAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch QThanks, folks. I appreciate the answers.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AYeah.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question,please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ed G. WestlakeAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QYes. Good morning and thanks for your time. Just coming more, I guess, back to the U.S., I mean your CapEx inthe upstream and your outlook is sort of relatively flat. I mean I appreciate there's some really big projects in theGulf of Mexico, but you have this emerging shale position not just in the U.S., also obviously up in Canada. Maybetalk about why you're not getting after that more aggressively? I actually saw some really good well results fromyou guys down in the Permian this morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. ASo you want us to spend more, Ed?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ed G. WestlakeAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QIn that area, potentially, but what stops you or...?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AWell, a couple thoughts. I don't know whether you – we've got a couple of different shale plays going on inCanada. One is in the Duvernay, which is liquids oriented and we've drilled, I think we're on our thirteenth well upthere and have had some good success. And we are looking to develop that at a good pace.Our approach to the shales is to make sure we understand what we've got and to plan in an orderly fashion so thatwe can keep costs in line commensurate with the production that we can generate. So I do agree with you. We'vehad some good results from those wells.The second, of course, is the Horn River and Liard Basin, which is gas to support the Kitimat project, whichthere'll be additional drilling in the Liard this year to delineate those holdings. And of course, that productionwould be associated with – over time with an LNG project at Kitimat.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ed G. WestlakeAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QAnd I was also referring to the Permian, obviously, where you've got a huge acreage position. It just feels that ifthat was in the hands of an independent, they'd be gung ho after it whereas it feels that, perhaps due to corporateCapEx constraints, you guys, or maybe delineation, are going a little bit slower.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AWell, I know that's what the independents tell you. What I'll tell you is we work very hard to put together a reallysustainable and capital-efficient plan over time. Having said that, we drilled some 460 gross wells in 2013, whichwas more than we had planned. We've got 26 rigs working in the basins there. About half of those actually arenon-op rigs as well as our own rigs. And I think you'll see that we are ramping up activity pretty nicely. In March,George will show you some charts that will give you a better feel for that. But I think you'll see a nice ramp -up bothin the number of rigs and in production that will come from that ar ea.I mean remember, one of the things that – we do try to be efficient with our capital, we are focused on makinggood returns, and so we do want to be sure that we can do it in a low cost fashion and do it in a way that willgenerate the kind of financial results overall that will keep us leading. I mentioned earlier that we lead in earningsper barrel relative to the majors, but we also have a big lead in return on capital and return per barrel relative to alot of the independents as well. So we may no t go as fast as some of the independents, but I think it's the right wayfor us to move forward.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ed G. WestlakeAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) QThanks, John.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AYeah.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question,please?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. QYes, good morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AMorning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. QJohn and Pat, maybe I have two question. Both of them is somewhat higher level. One is from a capital allocationstandpoint, obviously, that the last several years the company has been going after a lot of the legacy long-termmega-project, which is great once they complete. But from a portfolio management standpoint, is there a pointthat you want to, say, maybe balance the portfolio a little bit between, whether from a product ion standpoint or acapital standpoint, between the mega-projects, which obviously have a higher risk in terms of the underlyingexecution and also somewhat binary in nature compared to a more steady, maybe shorter -term projects? That'sthe first question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AOkay. Well, certainly, we do quite a bit of work, Paul, on portfolio management to do just as you described. In fact,we try to balance the portfolio in many ways, but certainly one is the balance between the investments in longtermprojects and short-term money.We consciously took on some projects that we felt were opportunistic and ready to go with Gorgon, Wheatstone,Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot. And so we knew that we had a heavy period of spend for those projects. But at thesame time, we've really maintained a very strong base business spend program. About 30% of our spend goes intosmaller capital projects.And you make a good point, because I just, for example, just happened to review our performance on small capitalprojects within the last couple of weeks, and the returns are quite good. These are typically incremental projects,incremental drilling projects to existing assets. And so we do maintain that spend. In fact, the discretionary spendthat we have is in that area. And we have announced a strong capital program for 2014. And my alternative waslargely to cut those base business spend. And we decided not to do that.So we try to balance both those factors so that we get strong returns on capital over time and get good growth, andwe've been able to do that. Despite all the capital that's in the queue, we still – from the numbers that we have, wethink we'll maintain our second position on return on capital employed.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. QJohn, overall, is there a ratio over the next 5 or 10 years that you want to have 50% of the capital on the legacymega project and 50% on the smaller and the base business, or that there's not even a ratio that you guys consideror look at?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AWell, we will have a higher – I think we've advertised before that we are moving toward a higher percentage oflegacy – what we call legacy or very low decline projects so that, as we get toward the end of the decade, we'll be atabout 60%. So things like Gorgon, Wheatstone, Tengiz, Angola LNG and the like, even some of our low-declineassets such as California heavy oil activity, is very low decline and we're moving to a higher level.The plus side of that is as you get those on line, the amount of spend that it takes to maintain them tends to befairly low. So we are moving to a higher level of what you would call legacy spend projects, and I think the y'lldeliver a lot of cash and stability for years to come once we get them all on line.Paul Y. ChengAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. QOkay. The second question is then, over the last couple of years that you've been borrowing money – or actuallynow since you've been borrowing money to fund the buyback, and as the balance sheet return to more normal, atwhat point, whether it's a fixed financial ratio such as net debt to capital or interest capital ratio, the company willstart to reconsider the buyback whether that – I mean, or that you would continue to borrow money to fund it?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AI'll let Pat talk a little bit about our philosophy on debt and the rating agencies and how much capacity we've got.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AAll right. And, Paul, we've said for a long time now that obviously our – from a cash distribution standpoint, thepriority is on dividend. Secondly, we reinvest in the business and cover up the strength of our balance sheet from apension funding standpoint and that kind of thing for the third priority. And then finally, it's share repurchasesthat become kind of the surplus use of cash.And we have also said several times here now that we were in an unusual net cash position for several years now.We would be moving into a net debt position. We have now done that. As I look forward, we still have atremendous amount of borrowing capacity available to us. We bel ieve that these – we're very confident in thefuture cash generation from these projects once they come on line. And so we can see our steady state here from ashared distribution standpoint on share repurchases. For a while, we also see intentions to cont inue to grow thedividend. We have a lot of flexibility in our balance sheet and I don't think that there's a consideration at least interms of steady macro condition that would suggest that we would be trimming our share repurchases at this time.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Paul Y. ChengAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. QThank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question,please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC QHey. Good morning, guys.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AHey, Evan.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC QHey, John, on the CapEx, I know that the organic cash CapEx exceeded your guidance by about $2 billion. As youassess that 2014 CapEx budget and what gives you confidence that you won't experience similar inflation? I meanis there anything different, any protections, conservatisms versus what happened as you – versus how you assess2014? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AYeah, our number of – take out the money for acquisitions that we had last year are my – the amount that wentover the budget, I think, was...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. A[indiscernible] (36:54)................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. A...lower than that. So I don't know we disclosed the exact dollars of those acquisitions, but it's somewhat lowerthan that. So I don't think we'd be having the conversation about capital had we not had those one -timeacquisitions. But candidly, if we hav e a supplement to a project, we're going to fund it in that year. In general, wemanage our budget pretty tightly and I have no reason to believe at this point that we'll exceed the $39.8 billionthat we put out there. We're sensitive to it, you're sensitive to it. So we will be watching it very closely.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC QSimilar and maybe this is something for the Analyst Day yet. As obviously organic CapEx, cash CapEx trend hereis flat and you mentioned a peak LNG spend in 2014, there are a lot of your peers that are forecasting a peakCapEx. So do you see a similar overall trend based upon your current slate of projects? And then maybe secondly,this is the other side of the question, is it – it's unclear what the world looks like in two, three, five years, let alonethe opportunities in the asset market, M&A market, resource market, et cetera. I mean do you see any real abilityto forecast a longer-term CapEx figure? And I will leave it at that.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AWell, it's a good question. One of the reasons – I've told you and others before, one of the reasons we haven't putout long-term capital forecast is because it's very hard to predict oil prices, foreign exchange, local contentrequirements, cost of goods and services. What we have been fairly good at understanding is the competitivenature of our project. So when we put out long-term production forecast, we've had a view that – we know theworld is going to need energy, we know that we've got projects that will compete because of the resource andgeneral nature of the project. And so we've been – frankly, we stepped out quite a bit in putting out a seven-yearproduction forecast and I feel pretty good about that. I t was harder to predict what the exact spend would be. Andthat's part of the reason I've been reticent to give a lot of guidance going out beyond two or three years.I know directionally the level of our activity and we do balance that, but I don't know what the macro environmentwill bring fully. And once we get projects that are under construction, we're obviously going to continue them. So Ihave a pretty good feel obviously for what spending will be this year and I have a pretty good feel for what spe nd isgoing to be in 2015 and 2016 and that's why we've given you this flattening comment where $40 billion this yearwill be in that same range give or take for the next couple of years. Beyond that, the macro conditions could dictatesomething different.We do try to be opportunistic when it comes to bringing resources into the portfolio. Last year, I think we broughtin some terrific resources into our portfolio at a good price. As you know, we supplemented our acreage in NewMexico in the Permian area. We brought in some good high-quality assets that were referenced earlier in theDuvernay. We think the Kitimat resource is a terrific one for the long-term. Argentina, we think – as far as weknow, it's the best shale outside of North America. So we took the opportunity to bring those into the portfolio andwe don't see as many opportunities in that space this year, for example. That's why I made the comment I didearlier about spend, but over time, we are in depleting resource business and you do need to add to the portfolio.We're careful how we do that. That's how we got to our leading position in earnings per barrel and we'll continueto be careful in how we do that going forward.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC QMaybe I could slip in just one last one on the asset disposal side. I know you mentioned in a response or yourcomments the midstream sale process monetization. I mean any update or any change in your thoughts theregiven you're growing unconventional base and a likely associate d midstream CapEx over time? Any changewhether that would be an outright sale or potentially forming an MLP? And I will leave it at that.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AYes. In fact, I will say there is a little bit of a shift. Let me be clear. We're not in shrink to grow mode, we're notresetting the base, we're not doing anything like that. That's not what we're doing. But just as we've done in thedownstream where we pruned the portfolio, I think Mike and his team have sold some $8 billion in assets over thelast six, seven years and those have been done in a very nice pace way to get good value.We're in the process right now of making some sales in our midstream business, for example. You referencedMLPs, our approach – we're not fond of the MLP structure as a way for us to hold assets, but we can sell intoMLPs and get that value. And so we have been selling pipelines and we'll continue to do so for pipelines wherethey're not critical to our upstream or downstream business; in other words, more merchant -type lines. We areselling lines. You've probably seen some commentary in the press to do that. We think we can get good valuethere.Similarly, we do have a lifecycle for asset sales in the upstream. And so there are some sales that are possiblethere. Our approach is not to talk a lot about the specific assets for commercial reasons, but I would say you'll seemore asset sale activity over the next two or three years in the upstream than you've seen over the las t few years.Certainly, there's been a lot of chatter about some leases that we're selling in Nigeria. Those, we think, will bring toa closure later this year and get good value for those. And I would say, overall, in the context of some of the bigheadline numbers others have said, our sales will be modest. But we will have a little bit more in the area of assetsales going forward.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Evan CalioAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC QAppreciate it. Thanks, guys.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. ASure.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Yourquestion please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Pavel S. MolchanovAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. QThanks very much for taking the question. You mentioned the ongoing reduction in domestic gas drilling and yetironically that's the one part of your domestic production that's actually been up for the last, I guess, three, fourquarters. Why do you think there is this disparity where domestic gas is rising, but oil and liquids have been indecline?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AWell, the area where we've been investing in the U.S. has been in the Marcellus and it's a function of the carry. Sothe volume increases that you're seeing, you'll recall we acquired Atlas Energy and some other tack -ons and wecame in with $1.3 billion carry where we're – as we go forward, we're funding a disproportionately low percentageof the cost for the revenue that we're getting. That carry is now down to $500 million. And our strategy has beento really build up a factory model, get our full costs in line so that as we end that carry three or four years fromnow that we'll be in a good competitive position on a cost per MCF basis once we get through that carry.In the meantime, we can afford to do the drilling. We obviously – wells that are drilled when you are funding 25%of the cost and getting 60% of revenue, I think that's a – the ratio is pretty good.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Pavel S. MolchanovAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. QSure. Now follow up on Kitimat, I think you've said in the past your aim is to reach FID this year. Is that still thecase? And what are the key question marks that would impede that from happening?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AWell, we're doing site clearance now. One of the things we've learned on big land -based projects is get yourinfrastructure in order and housing and things of that sort. So that's what we are doing. We are pacing this projectvery carefully as you would expect and what we have said is that FID will be entirely a function of gas contractsand that allow us to develop the opportunity and provide energy to Asian markets at a fair price. And it 's no secretthat there is a lot in the media on that subject right now. We are actively working with gas customers today.My view hasn't changed since the view Joe Geagea described to you last year, which is LNG projects are expensivewhether they're in West Canada, West Africa or East Africa or the Gulf Coast of the U.S. or Australia. And we'regoing to need robust pricing in order to make those projects go. And so there are some projects that may be builton existing facilities in the Gulf Coast of the U.S. that have gone to FID and we'll add some capacity that may beslightly lower cost. But once you get to brownfields, whether it's Gulf Coast or elsewhere, I think we're going toneed either oil link pricing or pricing that very clearly will give us the kind of return we need. So I guess what I amsaying is FID will be a function of gas contracts.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Pavel S. MolchanovAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. QAll right. Appreciate it.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. ASure.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allen Good from Morningstar. Your question,please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Allen GoodAnalyst, Morningstar Research QGood morning, everyone.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AMorning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Allen GoodAnalyst, Morningstar Research QJohn, you mentioned a little bit on the downstream sales and restructuring. Just a question on that. Is thatbusiness currently sized right for Chevron and do you see any other opportunity there to potentially reduce capitalemployed on the downstream side?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AWell, our downstream business if you look at the direction we've gone, we actually have done quite a bit ofpruning over the last few years. We've basically gotten out of the disconnected marketing or marketing that'sdisconnected from our refining system and then we did get out of a refinery in Europe that we think was very well -timed. And so what that's left us with is a strong U.S. business with good positions along the Gulf Coast andthrough the West Coast of the U.S. and then a strong business in Asia.We think – we always take a look at the portfolio, but in general I think our downstream portfolio is in pretty goodshape. I might have told you a few years ago that inland refineries or small refineries would be tough, but frankly,those have been some of the most profitable with the one in Salt Lake and Burnaby, British Columbia. So I feelpretty good about the portfolio overall in the downstream.The capital that we are putting in the downstream business is really geared toward the chemicals business now.We've got a base oil plant that's coming up in Pascagoula that will make us the largest top-tier base oil producer inthe world. We've got our share of the petrochemical complex that we're building with Phillips 66 through ChevronPhillips Chemical Company. That's a $6 billion project. Our share is $3 billion. We think that's going to be aterrific project. As far as we know, we are ahead of other projects in the area. We have got the permits and havegone to FID. Overall, we think we can generate mid-teens kinds of returns in this business and so we think it's agood one.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Allen GoodAnalyst, Morningstar Research QYeah, I guess on the chemicals, I mean you mentioned a product upcoming and certainly that's a very goodportfolio there. But I guess relative to the size of Chevron total, it's still relatively a small piece. Do you think themarket is accurately crediting you for that business? And if not, do you think there is way potentially to monetizethat through, I don't know, Phillips 66 or spinning that off separately? Or is your plan really just to hold out forthe long-term and continue to build that up?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AOur plan is to hold it. It's about 15% of our capital. We disclosed the segment information. I think you guys havesharp enough pencils to be able to figure out what it brings to us. But more importantly than that, there are somelinkages in the business that I think are very, very important. I don't think splitting up the business makes you anindependent.We have some very significant linkages to the downstream business, and I'll give y ou just a couple just as a forinstance. Southern California, our El Segundo Refinery, we've got heavy crude going out of San Joaquin Valley.We've just augmented some facilities at the El Segundo Refinery specifically so it can take more San JoaquinValley crude. We think that's a good synergistic type of investment. Over the years, we've had high mercury crudein Asia and we've put in specific facilities to be able to capture the value benefit associated with that.I think when you look in the middle of the country today, I think it makes all the sense in the world to be anintegrated company. You've had tremendous volatility in the relationship in crude pricing and you either captureit in the refinery or you capture it on the upstream side, just depending upon how infrastructure moves, and we'recapturing that in Salt Lake. So I frankly think that the integration story for us is pretty straightforward.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Allen GoodAnalyst, Morningstar Research QOkay, great. Thanks for the comments.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. ASure.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question,please?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D. ReadAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC QYeah, good morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AGood morning.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D. ReadAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC QI guess a lot of the stuff has been hit. I just wanted to kind of follow up on, I guess, Q4 and the upstream in theU.S. and if that had any implications for how we should look forward. I understand on the production side and aswe modeled it, the realization for prices looked okay. I know as I went through the – or as you went through thepresentation, it showed realizations down. I was wondering, is that a cost issue realization, sort of a netrealizations, as opposed to just a price realization? And if so, what kind of occurred in the fourth quarter, and isthat a one-time issue or a recurring issue, any help you can provide there?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp. ASo, Roger, I can help with that. This is Jeff. It's not a net realization, it's a price realization, and it was consistentwith the markers that you see in the market for the fourth quarter.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D. ReadAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC QOkay. So I mean more or less what occurred in the fourth quarter we should look at as being an issue goingforward? I mean as crude prices move around, that'll change, but just the market conditions?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp. AThat's exactly right.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D. ReadAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC QOkay. And then as we look forward into 2014, especially at the end of the year, say, Jack/St. Malo starts up, you'vegot continued growth probably in California. Should we look at that as helping out the realization story in the U.S.,North America?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Jeff GustavsonGeneral Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp. AAgain, I guess it depends on your view of prices. So we are, out of our U.S. production, we're about a thirdweighted to California prices, which obviously is separate from what's going on in the Mid-Continent. We're abouta quarter weighted to Mid-Continent or WTI prices, and about a third weighted to the Gulf of Mexico. So I meanthat, as Jack/St. Malo comes on, as Big Foot comes on, the weighting in the Gulf of Mexico may increasesomewhat. There's not a lot of growth in the California business. And at the same time, we have the ramp -up inthe Permian. So it really goes back to what your view of the different markers are in those three separate regions.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D. ReadAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC QSure. Okay. That's helpful. And then any additional update you can provide as you look at the Vaca Muerta kind ofdrilling plans 2014 and 2015? When would we potentially see anything on a production side? I know you made thecomment it's a great shale, just wondering when would we maybe see something tangible that we can start to fixon?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AWell, I think you'll start to see it going forward from here. We're producing 16,000 barrels a day gross. That's a100% number. And so one of the reasons I made the comment about it being a good investment is there's lots ofoil infrastructure there now. So it's right in the middle of an oil producing area. YPF is doing a nice job. We'resending in some technical and other people to support them. But we got 15 rigs running. We think over time thatit'll get up to 19. And so we're optimistic that we'll see continued growth. I'll just say we just recently close d thetransaction, so it's very early days at this point. But there's probably more to come, but you should start to seebenefits in production here before too long.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Roger D. ReadAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC QOkay. Thank you.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AAll right. Next question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Hutton from RBC Capital Markets.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Peter W. HuttonAnalyst, RBC Europe Ltd. (Broker) QGood morning, good afternoon from London. Actually, my first question is a follow-up from the last one, which isabout the liquids realizations in the U.S. And you mentioned these are in line with the benchmarks. Well, fromwhat I can see when I follow the trend, that's right when you're looking against the third quarter, but the thirdquarter had the highest discount between your average realization and WTI since the 2008 peak. So is it twoquarters when we've had discounts of the order of something like $10 shortfall. And so I guess I'm asking the samequestion in a different way. Is that something that we should also expect to see during the course of 2014 until youstart to get more production out of the Gulf of Mexico from Jack/St. Malo? And then I have a follow-up which isactually my original question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AYeah. I don't know if we've got anything fundamental for you. Maybe right for Jeff to follow up with you offline tosee if there is something in the markers that we're not covering here, but there are some lags in pricing that takeplace in the U.S. But if you wouldn't mind, Peter, maybe we'll follow up offline and see if we can get to thosespecifics.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Peter W. HuttonAnalyst, RBC Europe Ltd. (Broker) QBe glad to. In the case, can I just come in with the question I was going to ask originally, which is on the reservereplacement rate and exploration. I think you mentioned 85% this year, which is down on the full year and oneyear is not a trend. But were there any areas where you have been focusing and that didn't come in, in the way thatyou had expected? And realistically where the focus is for this year and can you give a figure of the budget forexploration spend in 2014, please?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AYeah, actually, the irony is this is a very good year for reserve replacement relative to what we had in our planbecause we have sort of base business type activity, infill drilling and the like, developments and additions,revisions off of the existing field and we had a very good year in that area. What we didn't have was a significantnumber of major capital projects that went to FID and that's why this number tends to be lumpy in any given year.So, well, on an ongoing basis, it was less than replacing 100% of production. That's why we quote the three -yearand five-year numbers, which are 100% or higher. So I think that's really my thought for you on reserves.Exploration this year is about $3 billion to $3.2 billion type of number this year. I'll tell you one of the challengeswe've had the last couple of years is getting our high impact wells drilled. We've got a great queue, but we –frankly in the Gulf of Mexico, we've been drilling so many development wells that we got to queue that's built upthere and so we're looking forward to, I think, we've got 14 or so high impact wells which we define as 100 millionbarrel or more prospects and we look forward to getting them drilled here over the next few years. But a little over$3 billion is the target for the year.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Peter W. HuttonAnalyst, RBC Europe Ltd. (Broker) QGreat. Thank you very much.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Patricia E. YarringtonChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Chevron Corp. AAnd we have time for one more question.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AYeah, one more question. Robert?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Robert Kessler from Tudor Pickering Holt. Your question,please.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Robert A. KesslerAnalyst, Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc. QHi. Thanks for fitting me in and I look forward to the Analyst Day where I am sure we will go through more detail.But in the meantime, I wanted to ask you for kind of an update on your Australia LNG cost and exposure toexchange rate. We still see volatility there. I know you are, of course, further through the spend on Gorgon at 76%,which would imply less exposure to the exchange rate on the surface. But I imagine more of the spend now is locallabor which I am assuming is price in Australian dollars. So just the latest sort of leverage to that exchange rate ifyou don't mind and then any rethinking of your plans not to, I guess, hedge foreign exchange going forward?................................................................................................................................................................................................................................John S. WatsonChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corp. AYeah, interesting question. Maybe the comment I will make, we have had a rollercoaster on foreign exchange inAustralia, as you point out. When we went to final investment decision back in 2009, the exchange rate wasroughly $0.86 and it ramped up as high as, I think, $1.05 or so. And that was part of the reason that wesupplemented the project. Our view at that time was not to hedge foreign exchange because we felt there havebeen a pretty strong correlation between oil prices and their currency and so we felt that our overall portfolio waspretty well hedged. And I think that proved to be a pretty wise decision.When we went to FID on Wheatstone, we did so and have assumed a parity exchange rate. So that's a $29 billionproject when we assume parity. This year, our spend on the two projects is roughly $10 billion and we estimatethat 7 0%, 7 5% of that spend is in Australian dollars. So with the Australian dollar tracking under $0.90 now,that's a positive for us going forward. We're owed a little something on this. So we're benefiting from it right nowand we don't do any hedging and I don't anticipate that we will, going forward.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Robert A.
