All right. Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On
the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President-Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager
of Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two.
Slide three provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were $571
million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments of $1.96 billion and other charges of
approximately $670 million relating to project suspensions and adverse tax effects, all of which were non-cash
charges stemming from a downward revision in the company's longer-term crude oil price outlook. Excluding
these special items, as well as asset-sale gains and foreign-exchange effects, earnings were $1.8 billion, or $0.97
per diluted share, approximately $400 million higher than first quarter on that same basis. A detailed
reconciliation of the special items is included in the appendix to this presentation.
Cash from operations was $7.2 billion, an improvement of $4.9 billion from the prior quarter. Our debt ratio at
quarter end was 17%. During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we
announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to shareholders of record as of August 19. We're currently
yielding 4.6%.
Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $7.2 billion during the second quarter and $9.5 billion
year-to-date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than in the first quarter, the result of higher crude prices.
We also benefited from strong cash generation from our downstream and chemicals business. Temporary working
capital effects reduced year-to-date cash flow by approximately $2 billion. We expect this impact to reverse in
future quarters. Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled approximately $3.9 billion, the vast majority of
which related to our sale in the interest in Caltex, Australia.
We are well ahead of pace on our four-year asset divestment program. In the past 18 months, we have recognized
asset sale proceeds of nearly $11 billion, compared to our stated $15 billion goal over the 2014 to 2017 time period.
Cash capital expenditures were $7.6 million for the quarter, essentially flat with the first quarter. Year-to-date
cash capital expenditures were $15.2 billion, down $2.2 billion or 13% compared with the same period in 2014. At
quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $12.2 billion and our net debt position was $19.4
billion.

Slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2015 earnings were
$5.1 billion lower than second quarter 2014 results. Upstream earnings decreased to $7.5 billion between
quarters. The impairments and other charges I noted previously accounted for $2.6 billion of this decline.
Significantly lower crude realizations and the absence of second quarter 2014 asset sale gains make up the
remaining variance between periods. Downstream results increased by $2.2 billion, primarily driven by higher
worldwide margins and gains from asset sales, principally the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia.
Operationally, the second quarter continued a positive quarterly pattern of high reliability, strong margins and
good cost management. The variance in the other segment was primarily favorable corporate tax items.
Turning now to slide six, I'll compare results for the second quarter 2015 with the first quarter of 2015. Second
quarter earnings were $2 billion lower than first quarter results. Upstream earnings decreased by $3.8 billion,
primarily reflecting the charges I previously discussed. Unfavorable foreign exchange effects and the absence of
first quarter asset sale gains and the positive UK tax adjustment were also large variances between periods.
Downstream earnings increased $1.5 billion as gains on asset sales were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign
exchange swing between the quarters. Operationally, the quarters were fairly comparable. The variance in the
other segment was primarily favorable corporate tax items, partially offset by higher corporate charges, including
severance accruals.
Frank will now take us through the comparisons by segment.

Frank Mount
General Manager, Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide seven, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $578 million lower
than the first quarter's results. Asset impairments and project suspensions across multiple assets, primarily as Pat
indicated, from a reduced price outlook, decreased earnings by $630 million. Higher realizations, consistent with
an increase in domestic crude prices, increased earnings by $190 million. Exploration expenses, mainly associated
with the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, decreased earnings by $70 million. The other bar reflects higher production,
which was more than offset by higher DD&A rates.
Turning to slide eight, international upstream earnings were $3.2 billion lower than last quarter's results. Asset
impairments, primarily at Papa Terra in Brazil, project suspensions and adverse tax effects from price changes
previously discussed reduced earnings by about $1.9 billion. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects
decreased earnings between periods by approximately $670 million. The absence of last quarter's gains on asset
sales and the deferred tax benefit from the UK tax change decreased earnings by $660 million. Increased
exploration expenses resulted in lower earnings of $170 million. Higher realizations increased earnings by $395
million, consistent with the increase in Brent prices between the quarters. The other bar primarily consists of an
unfavorable ruling on a decade-old tax issue and severance accruals booked in the second quarter.
Slide nine summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second
quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 85,000 barrels per day between
quarters. Major capital project ramp ups, primarily at Jack/St. Malo in the Gulf of Mexico and from the expansion
of the Bibiyana field in Bangladesh increased production by 22,000 barrels per day. Growth from our shale and
tight assets, primarily in the Permian, contributed 11,000 barrels per day.
As we foreshadowed in our first quarter earnings call, production in the Partitioned Zone was shut down at the
end of May based on the inability to secure work and equipment permits. The shutdown decreased production in
the second quarter by 38,000 barrels per day. We're still not producing in the Partitioned Zone, and we have no
updated guidance as to when production is likely to restart. Planned and unplanned downtime reduced
production by 34,000 barrels per day between periods, primarily in Canada and in Australia. Price and cost
recovery effects decreased production by 23,000 barrels per day between quarters as high crude prices and
reduced spending decreased volumes associated with production share and variable royalty contracts.
The remaining variance in the base business and other bar primarily reflects natural field declines and weatherrelated production limitations at Tengiz.
Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter of
2015 and the second quarter of 2014. Net production increased by 51,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major
capital projects increased production by 71,000 barrels per day due to production ramp-ups, primarily in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Bangladesh. Shale and tight production increased by 46,000 barrels per day due to
the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, the Marcellus and the Vaca Muerta shale in
Argentina. Price and cost recovery effects increased production by 61,000 barrels per day due to the roughly 45%
drop in crude prices between periods.
The shutting of operations in the Partitioned Zone decreased production by 45,000 barrels per day. Asset sales
resulted in lost production of 33,000 barrels per day, principally driven by the divestment of our assets in Chad
and the Netherlands. The decrease of 49,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar primarily reflects
normal field declines and the impact of higher external constraints, partially offset by a favorable variance from
less planned turnaround activity. Our base business continues to perform well with a managed decline rate within
our existing guidance range.
Year-to-date net oil equivalent production was 2.638 million barrels per day and within our 0% to 3% guidance
for 2015 growth. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, the third quarter is expected to be a comparatively
heavy turnaround period, and we believe the full year production guidance remains appropriate.
Turning to slide 11, U.S. downstream results increased $25 million between quarters. Tight product supply,
primarily on the West Coast, boosted refining and marketing margins and increased earnings by $165 million
between quarters. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $185 million, reflecting planned maintenance
and turnaround activities at the El Segundo Refinery and commitments related to the Richmond Refinery
modernization project. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects stronger results in our chemicals
business.
Turning to slide 12, international downstream earnings improved by $1.5 billion between quarters. Gains on asset
sales, primarily related to the sale of the company's interest in Caltex Australia, increased earnings by $1.7 billion.
Lower refining and marketing margins decreased earnings by $120 million between quarters as product price
increases, including the negative price lag effects on naphtha and jet fuel failed to keep pace with rising crude
costs. An unfavorable swing in the foreign currency effects lowered earnings by approximately $155 million. The
variance in the other bar reflects multiple unrelated items.
Jay will now provide an update on our upstream operations. Jay?

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

Thanks, Frank. Turning to slide 13, I'm going to discuss our Upstream business, where we continue to make good
progress in delivering the projects that are driving our growth in volume, in value and in cash. Gorgon is a critical
part of that growth, and we continue to work towards the first LNG cargo. As you can see from the photo, plant
construction has advanced. We're nearing mechanical completion of the first train with over 60% of critical
subsystems handed over to commissioning. We've posted new pictures today and I encourage you to look at them
on our investor website and chevron.com.
Turning to slide 14, the upstream work scope for initial production from the Jansz field is largely complete with
the control systems now active. We've established communications from the central control room on Barrow
Island to the subsea wells, which enables us to conduct commissioning activity on the upstream and pipeline
systems. Final testing is underway for the subsea infrastructure and controls. At the plant, all LNG and
condensate tanks required for first LNG are ready and commissioning of completed process systems is underway.
Currently the critical path is through the refrigerant compressors and the hydrate prevention system for the
subsea wells.
We expect to perform the first commissioning run of the compressors and testing of the hydrate prevention
system in late September. Once we're satisfied with the operation of these systems we'll be ready to introduce gas
from the Jansz wells into the upstream pipeline and begin the startup of Train 1, which we currently expect late
this year. The schedule is dependent on managing commissioning and startup risks, including equipment
malfunctions, possible labor and weather disruptions, as well as other unforeseen issues. Our focus is on a safe
and incident-free startup that leads to reliable long-term operations. We're working to achieve the first LNG cargo
by year-end. However, given these risks, it's likely to occur in early 2016.
Now let's talk about Wheatstone, moving to slide 15. Wheatstone is now over 65% complete. On the upstream side
of the project, we successfully completed the float-over and installation of the offshore platform in April. Hook up
and commissioning is on plan with all subsea structures now installed. The flow line installation is underway and
the development drilling program ongoing. All nine wells were previously drilled to the top of the reservoir and
we're now drilling the reservoir sections of each well and running the completions. At the plant site, 11 of 24 major
process modules for Train 1 have been delivered. All refrigeration compressors and gas turbine generators have
been installed and the domestic gas pipeline has been completed. The focus of activity at the plant has shifted
from civil works to mechanical, electrical and instrumentation systems.
The work on site is going very well. Our biggest challenge has been the delays in module delivery from a
fabrication yard, which is putting pressure on the schedule. To address the delays, we've expanded to an
additional yard and provided increased oversight in the yards. We've seen positive results from these actions and
are not anticipating any further delays in the module delivery schedule. Additionally, we've increased bed capacity
at the plant site and are updating our work plans to mitigate the impact to schedule. Our objective remains first
LNG by year-end 2016, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress over the next 18 months.
Turning to slide 16. Performance at the Jack/St. Malo lower tertiary development continues to exceed our plan.
The sixth well was brought online ahead of schedule and total production has ramped up to around 80,000
barrels per day. The development drilling program continues and we're seeing some get improvements in cycle
time, costs, and stimulation effectiveness with the most recent completion 20% better on cost and schedule than
previous wells. Work to install the Big Foot Tension Leg Platform was suspended in early June when nine of the 16
tendons lost buoyancy. There were no environmental impacts or injuries, and we are investigating the root cause
of the incident. We have secured the site, including successful recovery of the seven remaining tendons. The
tension leg platform was undamaged and is being moved to a safe harbor location.
Site surveys and equipment inspections are in progress to determine whether the installed piles and recovered
tendons can be reused and what equipment will require replacement in order to complete the project. At this
point, we are not expecting any Big Foot production in 2016 or 2017, which is a reduction from our original plan of
10,000 net barrels per day in 2016 and 22,000 net barrels per day in 2017. As we complete the investigation and
update our plan, we will advise you accordingly.
Appraisal drilling is ongoing at the Anchor discovery and in the Northwest Keathley Canyon area, now named
Tigris. Tigris has the potential to offer a multi-field, hub development of the Guadalupe, Gila and Tiber discoveries
with the potential addition of the Gibson exploration prospect, which we plan to drill around the end of this year.
Appraisal drilling is underway at Guadalupe and recent results from deepening the Gila discovery well are
encouraging with further appraisal planned. We continue to progress our opportunity cue in the deepwater and in
the second quarter made another lower tertiary discovery at the Sicily prospect in Keathley Canyon Block 814.
We're encouraged by the results of the discovery well and follow-up appraisal work is planned.
Turning to slide 17. As we communicated in March, our Permian position is strong. We have a large, high-quality
acreage position with advantage royalty, which we are cost-effectively developing. We remain on track to drill 325
wells this year and have expanded to multiple factory mode, horizontal well development programs across the
Midland and Delaware basins.
We remain committed to our pace development approach, but the short cycle nature of these investments allows
us to adjust this pace relatively quickly. In the current market, we've been active in negotiating cost reductions
with our suppliers, achieving rate reductions of 20% to 50% across our major drilling and completion spend
categories. At the same time, we continue to improve our drilling and completion efficiency. Since last year, we
achieved roughly a 15% increase in drilling footage and a 20% increase in frac stages per day. The initial
production rates for these wells are also very encouraging with our Bradford Ranch laterals averaging 1,100
barrels a day and comprising around 90% liquids. In addition, current estimated well recoveries have increased by
30%.
So in summary, cost reductions, improved efficiency, and increased recoveries have improved our development
cost per barrel by around 35% relative to 2014 and make more than 3,000 well prospects economic at $50 per
barrel WTI.
Let's move to slide 18. The major capital projects driving our growth are nearing completion, and are underpinned
by our strong base business. The volumes associated with this growth are accretive to our cash margins and will
contribute to long-term cash flow. We've reduced our current year capital spending by $5 billion relative to 2014.
In the current environment, we are planning to reduce our 2016 and 2017 capital programs and our flexibility in
capital spending significantly increases as our projects already in execution are completed.
We are pacing projects not yet in execution to ensure we capture the cost advantages presented by the current
environment and are prioritizing them to manage our capital program. We continue to drive cost reduction and
efficiency to strengthen our cash flow by systematically reviewing our organizational structures and activity levels
in our business units and by working with our suppliers.
Pat will now conclude by sharing the enterprise impacts of these efforts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President

All right. Turning to slide 19, I'd like to now provide an update on the self-help efforts that we have underway to
lower our costs and improve our efficiency. To-date, we've identified more than $3 billion of spend reductions
with about half coming through organizational reviews and half working through the supply chain. On the
organizational side, efficiency reviews have recently concluded that covered our corporate gas and midstream and
service company group. Similar reviews are occurring on a rolling basis within our upstream business units. Work
activities in these identified groups have been prioritized, streamlined, and right-sized to the current
environment.
Savings totaled approximately $1.4 billion on a full run rate basis and represent both dollar and workforce
reductions off the relevant base of about 20%. These benefits to our cost structure should become increasingly
evident as we move through the next several quarters. In future periods, we expect to see additional savings
identified as our remaining upstream units complete their reviews. We're also aggressively pursuing savings
through the supply chain, particularly in the U.S., where our supplier responsiveness has been high. We have
negotiated an excess of $1 billion in immediate savings, achieving product category reductions of typically 15% to
30%.
We are also changing the way we work through greater standardization, project re-scoping, refinement of fit-forpurpose designs, and timing optimizations. In combination, we estimate negotiated savings and work changes will
lower our future supply chain spend $1.6 billion. These savings will appear in multiple ways as we move through
2015 into 2016. Impacts will come in the form of lower operating expenses, lower capital and lower cost of goods
sold. And we're not done. We expect more supply chain savings to be identified in future months, particularly as
activity continues to flow and as additional spare capacity emerges. We are being aggressive in pursuing these selfhelp measures in response to a very challenging industry environment.
Moving to slide 20, I'd like to close with a few thoughts. We made a commitment to our investors in March. We
said we would cover the dividend from free cash flow in 2017. We stand by that commitment. We are taking the
steps necessary to ensure we are a resilient competitor regardless of the ensuing price environment. Our focus
areas are shown on the slide, get our capital projects currently under construction online, rebase and reprioritize
our capital outflows, maintain reliability and drive our cost structure lower, and conclude our planned divestment
program. If a lower price environment persists for longer, you'll see even more significant cost savings and even
greater cuts in capital. As we showed you in March, we have tremendous flexibility in our 2017 C&E spend. We are
confident that we can and are committed to scaling our C&E outflows in a manner that will allow us to continue
our 27-year record of annual dividend payment increases.
So that concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in. We're now ready to take your questions.
Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up if
necessary. And we'll do our best to get all of your questions answered.
Jonathan, please open the lines for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] And once again, we ask that you please limit
yourself to one question and one follow up. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from
Jefferies. Your question, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason D. Gammel
Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Yes. Thanks very much. First of all, if I could just ask on Gorgon. Jay, you mentioned the key risks still to getting
to the first commercial cargo included labor risks, and there has been a lot of media attention to the – one of the
unions that is employed by one of your primary contractors. Do you have any update on any industrial actions that
could prevent getting that first commercial cargo in early 2016?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

Thanks for the question. At this point, the work with the contractors and the unions to agree a new contract is
ongoing. The discussions continue. There was a fourth vote that was unsuccessful recently, and so the unions have
requested and received permission to seek a strike vote, but there is warning time that has to occur before that
happens. At this point in time, any action that would occur would be relatively short in duration, 24 hours or less,
and we would have ample warning time before that would occur.
But I think it's important to recognize that a strike at this point is really not going to be in anyone's benefit and so
the negotiations continue between our contractors and the unions, and I'm optimistic that they will be able to find
a solution and a way forward. I think the issues have largely been addressed. The primary one appears to be just
around work schedules, and so that's an area that's receiving quite a bit of focus as we move forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason D. Gammel
Jefferies International Ltd.

Q

Okay. Appreciate that. If I could, just as a follow up, ask a question about the charges that were recorded in the
quarter for project suspension. Would you be able to give us any examples of projects that are being deferred and
the level of CapEx savings that's being associated with these deferrals?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

We really aren't going to go into any specific projects that have been deferred, but as we look at our pre-FID
capital, the projects that have not moved to sanction, we're really looking to do either deferments as we slow them
down to take advantage of the current market environment, build lower cost structure into this projects. We're
also looking to pace those projects as we build our capital programs looking ahead to 2016 and 2017. But some
projects that we feel are not going to be competitive rather than keep them moving we've just elected to go ahead
and suspend those and those costs reflect some of those projects that we've suspended.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. Thanks for your thoughts, Jay.

please?

Q

Hey. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil M. Gresh
JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

First question, I appreciate the additional color on the operating cost reduction potential and if we think about the
capital cost side, looking at your Analyst Day deck, you had a grey bar with respect to capital costs of about $20
billion in 2016, so I guess I'm just wondering like how much reduction potential is there from a deflation
standpoint, a deferral standpoint, and really if you kind of wrap it all together with the operating costs, your
guidance at the Analyst Day suggested that you could cover your dividend at $70. So how low do you think that
could go given where we are in this current oil price environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President

A

So I think there's two elements there. Let me just start with the last component here. Really, we did say we would
cover our dividend from free cash flow at the $70 price. What I was trying to indicate in my earlier words is we
intend to cover the dividend from free cash flow at whatever the ensuing price is. That is a firm commitment on
the part of the company, and we have tremendous flexibility, really, in our 2017 C&E to flex that down. We are
being very successful in driving our operating costs lower and working through the supply chain to accomplish not
only operating expense but capital reductions as well. And that really is an affordability component for us. It's a
cash flow management element for us, and after we get these projects that are currently under construction
online, that flexibility in C&E becomes quite significant in 2017. So I'll let Jay talk to his prioritization process in
terms of looking at the capital program in 2017.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

So as we're building – we're in the process of building our plan right now for 2016, 2017, and 2018. And as we go
through, as we've said before, our primary focus first and foremost is on putting the investment back into our base
business around asset integrity and maintaining good, reliable operations. And then we also fund the major
capital projects that are in execution and as you have seen in our slides, that will decrease significantly as these
projects come online. Just for example, in our LNG projects, this year we expect to spend around $8 billion in
LNG, C&E, but by 2017, that's down to $1 billion. So we'll see tremendous flexibility coming in just from that.
At the same time, we're looking at our base business, and as I mentioned, we are bringing our costs down, our
efficiencies up, so we're seeing very good performance out of our base business and able to compete even in this
environment. So we're evaluating how much money to put back into the base to maintain and continue to grow,
particularly the short cycle, high value returns. And then finally, we're looking at the projects that are pre-FID,
and as I said, we want to build in the lower cost structures, and we want to be able to preserve the option so that as
prices recover, we can decide at what pace and how to ratably bring these projects back into the program. Moving
engineering forward so that we have better definition, better understanding of these projects is a very low-cost
way to build more confidence into our program for the future.
And the last area is our exploration. We've been very successful in the last several years, so we've built up a bit of
an inventory on the resource side, and so we can pull back on exploration over the next couple of years as we
consolidate and wait for prices to recover. So I would see a dramatic and significant reduction in capital as we
move forward. We're building that into our plans but the exact amount is yet to be determined.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil M. Gresh
JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question in just in light of the commentary about Big Foot, some of the
risks around Gorgon and Wheatstone, maybe you could just discuss your degree of confidence with the 3.1 million
barrels a day production target for 2017 at this point, and to what degree you might be able to quantify what you
see as the downside risk, because I know there was some cushion in that at one point, but maybe just kind of
update us with your latest thoughts on that? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

We still feel very confident about the growth we're going to deliver, and that's primarily because the growth is
captured and driven by these major capital projects that are currently in execution. And as I said, we'll continue to
fund those and bring those to completion. So that growth is there, it's real, and it's based on our underlying base
business performance, which has been very strong, and we've done a good job of being able to maintain our
underlying decline rates. But we're in a different world, and so we're seeing costs change, obviously as the cost –
or prices structures have come down, costs are moving, and so just as we did with North American gas, there's still
opportunity to make adjustments in how we continue to invest in some of the shorter cycle opportunities. So I see
us as having a very strong base. The growth, we're very confident with that. The level of the divestment, the level
of base business, those can be some factors that go into it, but on balance, we are very strong on the growth
prospect and the growth story that we presented to you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question,
please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Edward Westlake
Credit Suisse

Q

Yes. Good morning. So maybe a small question to begin with. Just obviously Big Foot delay and then you're
talking about extra fab space for Wheatstone and extra beds, I presume that the CapEx impact that you might be
able to speak to or not and then obviously would you be able to offset that with the cost reduction efforts that the
industry is going through?

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream

Thanks. That's a good question. With Wheatstone, when you put extra beds in, there are some costs associated
with that. At the same time, because the modules were delayed, we didn't build up the manpower initially as we
had originally planned, so there were some savings early on. But in general, we're facing cost pressure on the
projects just as we are around the world. At the same time, we're seeing very favorable exchange rates in Australia
that are a countervailing force to that. So we're still working under the cost forecast that we've already provided to
you. We'll continue to monitor that and see how we progress through the next 18 months, and we'll update you if
we feel costs have changed significantly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Edward Westlake
Credit Suisse

Q

Right. And then this is a broader question. There was a period where Chevron had very good project execution,
and then there have been, obviously, some well publicized setbacks more recently. If there was one change or one
message that you were trying to get to investors and to the organization about how to hold on to better project
execution, what would that message be, and is there any anecdotes or data to illustrate that that is changing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

That's also a good question. I think what we have seen, some degradation in terms of performance, and it's driven
by a couple of things. One, the projects have been very large and complex. In and of itself, that's not just
something that should be difficult to manage, but because of the number of projects being simultaneously
managed I think both the industry's resources were stretched thin as well as our own resources to manage these
projects was stretched thin. As we now consolidate and finish this big wave of projects that drives the growth that
we have, roughly 20% from 2014 to 2017, we won't see that kind of sustained effort to maintain that growth going
forward. It'll be at a much more moderate pace. So I think we'll have the more ratable queue of projects back into
the range that's more straightforward to manage.
At the same time, we're also working to lower the cost structures and increase the predictability of these projects
by advancing engineering before we move them to FID. So as I mentioned on many of our pre-FID projects such
as FGP, we talked in March about advancing the engineering past 50%, that 40% to 50% range by the time we take
FID. Just as an example, you're looking for a proof point, when we took Gorgon to FID, we had modeled 12-inch
pipe and larger in our 3D CAD models at the time of FID. FGP will have 3-inch and larger pipe in our system and
sketches done for everything below that. So there's a great deal more definition in the design before we're moving
these projects forward. So I think the combination of having a more ratable program along with better
engineering, more advanced, higher-quality engineering will pay dividends for us.

Paul Y. Cheng

Q

Jay, if I could, two questions. If you're looking at a company the scope and size of Chevron on a going-forward
basis – historically that you spend most of your capital in the long cycle macro development, how is that going to
change, and is there – may be a sweet spot how that's going to shift between the short cycle and long cycle
development effort going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream

Yes. I think as you look at projects like the Wheatstones, the Gorgons, the FGPs and TCO, these are projects that
will add very large base and very long term assets to our portfolio. As we execute our small capital projects, which
are often infill drilling programs, work-over programs and de-bottlenecking, we typically see rates of return above
50%, and they're built on these assets, we've already made the investments. So I think we're really doing a good
job of rejuvenating our base and putting some new life into the base that we can continue to exploit over a long
period of time, but at the same time we're building our capability day by day in our ability to go after the shale and
tight largely in North America and in Argentina.
So as you've seen our performance numbers continue to increase, we're coming down that learning curve and
we're becoming more and more competitive, and it's going to give us a very good balance between deepwater
projects, large base projects in the LNG and sour gas as well as access to the shorter cycle of shale and tight
unconventional projects. So I see a very good balance and a very good diverse portfolio [indiscernible] (39:21).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Y. Cheng
Barclays Capital, Inc.

Q

Is there a percentage that you can share that on the going forward basis there was that capital spend between the
long and the short cycle going to look like?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

At this point in time, I don't have a ratio or a percentage to share with you. Our resource base has increased about
15%. Our portfolio has increased in the unconventional side by about 15% over the last five years in particular. So
we're seeing more of our resource base being the unconventionals but the unconventionals have very high, very
fast decline rates, and that is always going to be something we balance against the longer-term projects with their
stable production. So that's something we'll work through as we react to market conditions, our view of forward
pricing and the capital that we want to invest across the portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

The second question is that, Jay, going back to your early comment, not just Chevron, it looked like the whole
industry the last maybe 10 years has got openly optimistic about their capability to deliver and execute. And so, it
seems like everyone is stretching themselves to the limit and we start seeing all these execution issues. For
Chevron, learning from the mistake of the last several years, have you changed the way – I mean you are talking a
little bit about more definition. But at the top how have you changed the investment decision process on the FID?
Will you be – I mean in the future – in the past the industry tends to just looking at the financial capability and
whether that you can afford the project and whether it is a good project. How that is going to change in the future
particularly for Chevron ?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

For Chevron, we have traditionally looked at individual products and the economic opportunity each project
presents in making an investment decision. I would say now in the current environment and looking forward,
there'll be two additional lenses that will be added to that decision. First and foremost, the project and the
economic proposition it presents, but then we'll be looking at what is the overall level of investment we want to be
making and also what is the level of human capacity we have to manage the projects? And those will certainly be
factors that we will build into the process, and we are building into the process now so that we can keep that as we
move forward.
We've also done a lot of work to put in what we call readiness reviews, and these are to make sure that both from a
design and a design assurance standpoint before the project moves to execution but also before we start up these
projects, we're going to readiness review that are much more rigorous and help us make sure we have the
resources and the capabilities in place to execute these projects as expected.

please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan Todd
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Maybe if I could do one follow-up on the costs, on the slide you have
there, on slide 19, there is the $3 billion and spend reduction targeted. I'm not sure if I miss it when you said it,
but is this all, is the CapEx and OpEx, is that all in the OpEx side? Can you estimate how much you've captured to
date, how far along you are at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President

A

Yeah, so the combination of the $3 billion is for both operating expense and capital. The $1.4 billion is
predominantly going to be operating expense, and the $1.6 billion is going to be a mixture of both and probably
leaning a little bit more towards the capital side of things. And from a – and these are elements that should begin
to show in an accelerated basis as we move through the third and the fourth quarter. I would say captured to-date
actually has been some but not a high proportion of the $3 billion total.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan Todd
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Q

Okay. And is there a timing on when you hope that this – something you hope to capture over the next year or two
years or...?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President

A

Oh, I think it will be more immediate than that. I mean think it will be into the third quarter and fourth quarter of
2015 with some carryover into 2016 as well. I mean, a large portion of the supplier engagement element there, a
billion dollars of that are negotiated price reductions off of planned 2015 activity. So those negotiations began, as
you know, back in the January, February timeframe, we're sort of concluded in the May, June timeframe and so
those rate reductions we should begin to see coming forward in the next half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan Todd

Q

Great. Thank you. Very helpful. And then maybe if, I appreciate the color that you gave earlier on Big Foot and the
contribution of Big Foot to the 2016 and 2017 plans. Could you maybe give the same numbers for what – in the
2017 plan, let's assume for the Partitioned Zone, and Angola LNG and maybe any updates you have on both of
those projects?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

Sure. And first I'll start with the PZ. The PZ, at this point in time, we have around 60,000 barrels a day to 70,000
barrels a day expected in the 2017 plan but we do not expect that field to still be shut in, in 2017. So my
expectation is that we will be able to resume operations. There is an issue that's being discussed between the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The impact on us is the difficulty receiving visas and equipment permits. So
we were unable to continue operations and we stopped operations there as this issue is addressed. Our goal would
be to return to normal operations in the short term as the – any other issues are continued to be worked out
between the two governments. And so we work and we're trying to support the activities in that area accordingly.
In terms of the ALNG, progress is moving along quite well there. We are completing the work on all the piping
modifications, you recall this is as a result of the acoustic-induced vibration analysis that was done, so that work
should be finishing up in the month of August, and then that will allow us to start the recommissioning process at
the plant. The other work, in terms of the conditioning equipment on the front end of the plant to handle the
diversity of the associated gas feeding the plant will be complete as are the technical bulletins. But we would
expect to see restart late the year and then sustain production in 2016 and onward. So that's really the status of
those two projects.

Hi, Neil.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil S. Mehta
Goldman Sachs & Co.

Q

So, Pat, I just want to talk philosophically about how you're thinking about the dividend and your strategy there.
Didn't raise the dividend in the third quarter, but the way we read the comments was that we'd look for you to
raise it here in the fourth quarter even if it's a nominal level, and it's a priority to continue to raise the dividend
going forward. I just wanted to confirm that and then get your thoughts on the broader dividend strategy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President

A

A good question. So our broader dividend strategy hasn't changed. Our financial priorities haven't changed.
Maintaining a competitive and growing dividend is our absolutely number one objective. What has changed,
though, is obviously our immediate financial environment, and so the board chose not to raise the dividend in this
quarter. I think that's a prudent action at this point because we're not running as strongly, certainly, as we would
like on both earnings and cash flow because of where commodity prices sit. And it's not – I would say it's probably
we're not in a very stable either revenue or cost environment. We have a lot of fluidity on those two components
here.

I will say the board is very committed to growing the dividend and seeing our pattern of dividend increases every
year materialize, but what's important here is that it's the annual dividend payment that has moved up every year.
That doesn't mean you get an increase in the per share every single year, because we typically have moved them in
the second quarter. So it's an annual dividend payment history that applies to the 27-year factor. So I think the
board is committed to that. We are committed to that.
So I would like to be able to say our entire objective is being able to grow the dividend when the time is
appropriate. We don't want to get out over our skis. We want to do it in a manner and at a time when we can see
that we can hold on to that increase, sort of in perpetuity. We don't want to put ourselves into a position where
we're pushing things, where we are having to fund the dividend off the balance sheet for an extended period of
time, so we'll do it as soon as the financials really allow us to get there. It is our number one priority, though.

Q

Thank you, Pat. And, Jay, a question for you around Latin America. Two regions in particular. Venezuela output
generally seems to be very robust across the country. Curious what you're seeing there and if you can comment on
your relationship with – just politically over there, and given some of the potential tensions? And then the outlook
for Argentina as well, it looks like a very powerful resource, obviously a dynamic political situation there as well,
but comments on both of those plays would be terrific.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

The performance in both of those areas has been good, and our relationships with the government in both
countries I'd characterize as very strong. We have a long history and we have worked hard to maintain both our
performance and our relationships. In terms of the unconventional play in Loma Campana, we are seeing
continued progress there. We have linked in that asset team, and they are tied to our North America asset teams,
so there's good sharing of the information as we continue to move down the learning curve, as we gain knowledge
from the industry and offset partners, we're plowing those back into the business, moving to consistent sets of
metrics. So that drive to continue to improve in the unconventional space is being applied in Argentina as well.
And so we're quite excited about that potential for that asset.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio

Q

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Good morning, everybody. I think you mentioned earlier the inability to slow offshore exploration spending in this
current environment or in your outlook here. But can you quantify exploration spending in 2015 and 2016 from at
least from an Analyst Day timeframe and discuss rate commitments that limit your flexibility into that timeframe.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream

Yeah, the Deepwater drilling that's going on in the Gulf of Mexico, of course, we have six rigs there, and it moves
back and forth between exploration and appraisal. So as we have exploration success, than rigs get taken out of
exploration and moved into more appraisal and development work. So for example, right now, we have, of the six
rigs, four are working on production and development wells and two are working on appraisal wells, and we'll
move some of those back into the exploration area. We currently expect to drill about 12, what we consider to be
high-impact exploration wells around the world this year. We continue to see activity in West Africa, Deepwater
West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico are two of our primary areas but we also have some other work in the
unconventional going on as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio

Q

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Right. So it's more of a shifting then maybe a reduction on the rig side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream

I think as we move forward, we're going to, on the rig side, we shift those back and forth. Of course, they're under
long-term contracts, the large Deepwater rigs. But in terms of some of the unconventional work, those rigs are on
shorter cycle, and we can move accordingly with our capital allocation.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Evan Calio
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Great, Jay. And since I have you while you're on the call, maybe a question on the Permian. Your EUR's are up
30% on the slides. Any color on the driver there, whether it's completion, lateral lengths, different zones? And
maybe just generally within your portfolio, given the returns, I mean is this region a net receiver of more capital
versus other areas where there may be more capital pressure in this environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream

Yeah, on the first question, I would say it's all of the above. As we're getting more effective in our drilling, we're
learning a lot from our offset operators and we're moving, as you know, from vertical wells to horizontal wells, and
our preference is to really be able to drill those 7,500 foot laterals. The IP rates are consistent with what we were
hoping for. We're seeing high liquids content in Bradford Ranch. So everything's looking pretty positive there and
when you combine that with the reductions we're getting from our cost of suppliers and the efficiencies, that's
what's driving that 35% reduction and our development costs per barrel. I would say that as we look forward, we
certainly see the Permian as a very lucrative area for us to continue to grow, but because so much of that acreage is
held by fee, we have the luxury of being able to moderate and decide just how much we want to put in there and
really can use that as a flywheel. As we put more infrastructure into the area, it really gives us increasing flexibility
and profitability as we move forward.

Q

On the industry deflation theme, I wanted to see if Jay could comment on whether – Jay, whether you think the
pace of cost capture that Chevron's experiencing is different between the U.S. and overseas markets, meaning is
one of them lagging the other? And also, do you think it's reasonable to believe that the pace of cost productivity
captured for larger companies like Chevron might lag that of smaller companies during this part of the cycle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

Good questions. I'll talk first about the U.S. versus International.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

We have seen a faster response in cost reductions in the U.S. than in the international side. A lot of that's driven
by the competitiveness of the U.S. market. There are more contractors out there, there are more service providers,
and you can work and make transition from one to another faster if needed. As you get into the international
environment, it varies country by country, but the barriers to entry can be much higher. There's often local
content issues. Many of these companies may be in joint venture with local companies. So it just makes it more
difficult sometimes to drive those costs lower in the short term. But what is happening is we're seeing the activity
levels come off substantially, and as activity levels come off, we're seeing that drive the cost structure lower. So I
think we will see, and particularly as low prices persist, we will see the international continue to come down. It
just hasn't been at the rate that we've seen in North America. I'm sorry, the second part of the question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Terreson
Evercore ISI

Q

Yeah. And also, Jay, do think it's reasonable that larger – that the cost productivity capture for big companies like
Chevron might lag that of the smaller companies during this part of the cycle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

Yeah. I think in North America the small companies can also drive costs down just as we do, because as I said,
there's enough competition for provision of goods and services that they can make those switches just as we can.
And so they can drive very, very rapid reductions in price. In the international area, what we're trying to do is
really work as an enterprise so that we are working with our major suppliers and coordinating our efforts to drive
those costs down around the globe. That's why I think a big company has some leverage that a small company
wouldn't. We can work with these very large companies to drive those efficiencies, to make sure that our global
contracts and terms and conditions support a lower cost structure.

Doug Terreson

Q

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

smaller firms don't have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Doug Terreson
Evercore ISI

Q

It seems like it would over some period. And then also, Jay, you talked about the neutral zone a few minutes ago
and it's obviously been shut in for a few quarters. And I know it's hard to know whether the Saudis and the
Kuwaitis are close to resolving their issues, but my question is if those fields were able to be brought back on
stream, over what period of time do you think this could happen? Meaning is this something that could occur over
months or is it quarters or is it a longer term period, given the extended nature of the shut in? So how do you
think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President, Upstream

Well, the fields were shut in – the Wafra field was shut in, in mid-May. So that kind of gives the beginning of the
timeframe. And obviously it depends on how long they remain shut in. If we were able to restart in the next couple
of months, I think we'd be looking at probably like about a six-month ramp-up to get back into kind of normal
operation. Obviously visas have to be issued, we have to get workers into the country, we have to get the facilities
restarted. So we've been doing steadily since the facilities were shut in, preservation work to make sure that the
facilities are protected and that we are ready for a restart. There's extensive planning around the restart. So I think
as we work to get approval to restart that field it really just depends on how long it's going to take before that
restart initiates. But at this point in time, we can restart in a relatively short period of time. Couple of quarters I
would say.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul B. Sankey
Wolfe Research LLC

Q

Yeah, given all the moving parts here, if we could just – I'm sorry if I missed it, but are we still reiterating the $3.1
million a day for 2017, and is that changing with the asset sale element here? I'm not clear if you've increased your
asset sale target. And I think your net asset sales from the $3.1 million a day, is that correct? And furthermore, is
the cash flow neutrality target dependent on asset sales? And I'm again not clear if you've increased the asset
sales. And finally, is the cash flow neutrality a number at which you keep volumes flat or you grow? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President

A

Yeah, so let me just go back and talk about the original objectives that we put out in 2017 and $70 oil and the cash
flow neutrality. That – the assumption that we had in there was independent of asset sales, at the $70 price. Now
depending upon where you go on price, I have indicated that we would continue to work our cost structure. We
would continue to work our capital outlays. I think we also need to keep asset sales in the portfolio. It is an arrow
in the quiver. It is a lever that we would have. And what we showed you back in March, we were cash flow neutral
covering the dividend without asset sales in there. Depending upon where prices end, obviously I think that's a
lever that we still need to have in the – available to us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

So when we gave you the SAM information in March, we had about 65,000 decrease from the 2014 to 2017 in
asset sales. And that, as Pat said, can certainly change as we determine what the level of asset sales is going to be.
But the $3.1 million is really driven by the major capital projects that are under construction that are going to be
coming online. I think one of the key points was, as we also said in March, those volumes that are contributed are
accretive from a cash margin standpoint. So as those projects come online, we still see that as the main driver of
our growth, and then we just have to evaluate both from a divestment standpoint and any moderation in capital
into the base, what the impacts of that might be.

Okay. So we're sticking with the $3.1 million. It's not necessarily contingent. You're not adjusting for asset sales
but neither are you adjusting for the project issues that you talked about in the call. The cash flow neutrality
doesn't or does include asset sales and can you grow from there in 2017 if you are cash flow neutral? Thanks.

Yeah, I think from the standpoint that the $3.1 million is an outcome. It was $3.3 million, and as the North
America gas pricing came substantially lower and we saw it staying lower, we pulled back some investment from
North America gas and brought our target down accordingly. At this point, we're still at $3.1 million, we still have
all these projects that are under construction and driving forward, but obviously, we just have to see if this very
low price condition persists. It may have some impact. The $3.1 million is good a number as an outcome that I can
drive it to at this point in time.
In terms of going forward, we'll actually see our capital programs. We've talked about moderate quite a bit because
we're not going to be trying to do the – and accomplish the organic growth that we're underway right now. So as
we look forward, we're evaluating that now, we'll see some momentum continue. Projects like Gorgon have two
trains that will come on, Trains two and Trains three and then the ramp ups that are associated with those Trains.
Wheatstone will have a second Train coming on. We'll have some other projects that are still in the ramp up
phase. So I see some momentum carrying past 2017. Those are also going to be strong volumes from a cash
margin standpoint. And then as we look out into the next decade, a lot of that is going to depend on the options
that we've been able to preserve and the degree to which we've moved to any of the pre-FID projects forward.
That's part of the work that's undergoing now in our business plan.

Okay. So I don't want to go on too much with it. But just a final specific, one with the cash neutrality does include
asset sales.

So in the $70 case, the answer was no, it did not. Depending upon what case you're going forward with here, a $60
case, a $50 case, whatever your case is, I want to preserve that degree of flexibility for us. Our primary levers are
going to be getting our cost structure down and getting our capital program down for whatever price environment
prevails out there. But depending upon where prices do go, I don't want to take off our available set of options. I
don't want to take asset sales off that available set of options.

Q

Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.

Hi, everyone. Can I just ask on the impairment exactly what it was that triggered it? Is it just oil price or is it
something about assets going up for sale or some geological review?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President

A

Yeah, so...

Q

And can you can say what oil price it is?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President

A

I can answer most of those questions here. The trigger really was a lowering of our corporate longer-term price
outlook on crude oil. We took that action in May, and as you know, when there's a trigger event like that, we do
need to run impairment tests on our assets. Any time there's a significant trigger, whether it be a reduced price
outlook or increased costs or some change in the geology in the reserve or production profile, those are elements
that when that trigger occurs we need to do the impairment reviews. And we have a process set up where we look
at that every quarter. In this particular instance, the vast majority of the impairments related to Papa Terra, and
that was a price-induced, crude oil price-induced impairment. We did have a couple of other smaller assets in this
category as well where they were assets held for sale where we were writing it down basically to what we felt was
the realizable value.

Q

And on the oil price? Is it possible to talk around that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington

A

Chief Financial Officer & Vice President

Right. We're not going to give you our proprietary oil price. I can just say the revised outlook was really based on
two factors. One had to do with the rate we were expecting of global GDP growth and in particular around China,
so we've seen softening in China, and we've taken our view of that down accordingly. And the second major factor
that lowered our overall price outlook had to do with the U.S. tight oil shale produceability. We've seen obviously
much stronger production coming out of the U.S. and with the ingenuity and cost efficiency of the U.S. industry
we've seen costs continue to fall, and economics of those barrels continue to rise, and so that puts more supply
onto the market place. And so it's those two factors that's led us to lowering our longer term price outlook.

Doug Leggate

Q

Thank you, and, guys, thanks for letting the call run over. I really appreciate you letting that. I just want to get on
with the end here. I guess I wanted to kind of follow up on a couple of things that Paul mentioned. I really had two
specifics. But $11 billion out of $15 billion on disposals, what is your thought on raising disposal target at this
point given that you've still got two and a half years left in the program? It would seem you've got a lot of upside
potentials. So that's my first.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patricia E. Yarrington
Chief Financial Officer & Vice President

A

All right. And we're not in a position to move that target at this point. We just moved that target back in March.
We feel very good about the assets that we've been able to move forward and the value that we have captured for
that. So we have a number of assets kind of lined up in our own mind about how we could meet that $15 billion
target over the next several months, 18 months or so. But it really will depend on whether or not that value is
capturable. And we're not going to just sell the asset for the sake of meeting a target. We want to capture value
while we do it. So I'm not in a position to raise that target at this point. We feel good about where we sit. When we
get to March of next year, if we have a different view, we'll update it at that time.

Q

Appreciate it. My follow up, and I guess last question of the call is on Gorgon, not so much on the timing of the
startup, I think Jay's been pretty clear on that, but the timing of getting to full capacity because obviously the cash
flow delta that comes from the slowdown in spending versus the cash flow contribution is quite important. And I
guess what I am getting at is if everyone is really starting to think lower for longer, what does the cash
contribution look like and how long does it take to get to full capacity? So, I don't know how you want to try and
answer that, but if you could help us with the contribution from Gorgon when it does come on, that would be –
Gorgon [indiscernible] (01:08:18) that would be very helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President, Upstream

A

So our current view on Gorgon is that each Train, the second Train should start up about seven months after the
first Train and then followed by four to six months for the third Train. And it should take around eight months on
the first Train to get to capacity is our plan, and then six months for Trains 2 and Trains 3. So you can kind of put
all that together to get a rough profile of what Gorgon's going to look like coming forward. And even in the lower
price environment the cash generation that it has is still substantial, so we're looking forward to getting that cash
on stream.
