Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to
Chevron's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference
call is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr.
Roderick Green. Please go ahead.

Roderick Green
General Manager-Investor Relations, Chevron Corp.

Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm Roderick Green, GM of
Investor Relations, and on the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO.
We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started,
please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements.
Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2.
Now, I will turn it over to Pierre.

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Thanks, Roderick. We delivered strong financial results in the second quarter, with the highest reported earnings
in over a year. Adjusted earnings were $3.3 billion or $1.71 per share. The quarter's results included special items
totaling $235 million, including a remediation charge in the Gulf of Mexico and pension settlement costs. The
reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.
Adjusted return on capital was near 8%, and we lowered our net debt ratio to 21%. Strong operating cash flow
enabled us to meet Chevron's top financial priorities. Our dividend was up 4%. We continued to execute our
efficient capital program, and we paid down $2.5 billion of debt. Despite lower year-to-date prices and margins,
first half 2021 quarterly average free cash flow is near 2018 levels, primarily due to lower capital and operating
costs, and contributions from legacy Noble assets.
We're maintaining strong capital and cost discipline. C&E is down 32% from a year ago, and we're lowering our
full year organic C&E guidance to around $13 billion, primarily due to lower spending at TCO and greater capital
efficiency across the portfolio. Operating costs are on track with our March 2021 Investor Day guidance of a 10%
reduction from 2019.
Adjusted second quarter earnings were up $6.2 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted upstream
earnings increased primarily on higher prices and liftings. Adjusted downstream earnings increased on higher
chemicals results as well as higher refining margins and volumes. All other was roughly unchanged between
periods.
Compared with last quarter, adjusted second quarter earnings were up about $1.5 billion. Adjusted upstream
earnings increased primarily on higher commodity prices and higher production in the US. Adjusted downstream
earnings increased primarily from strong chemicals results, as well as increased refining margins and volumes. All
other charges were roughly flat between quarters and are running ahead of ratable guidance, primarily due to tax
charges and valuation of stock-based compensation. The all other segment results can vary between quarters
and our full year guidance is unchanged.
I'll now pass it over to Jay.

Thanks, Pierre. Second quarter oil-equivalent production increased 5% compared to a year ago. The increase in
production was driven by Noble acquisition and lower curtailments, partially offset by normal field declines, pricerelated entitlement effects, and asset sales.
Turning to the Permian, we continue to incorporate greater efficiency into our activities. Even with our reduced
activity levels, production is expected to be comparable to last year. Consistent with the guidance we shared in
March, we're adding rigs and completion crews in the second half of this year, delivering an expected production
rate of over 600,000 barrels a day by year end.
For 2021, we expect free cash flow, excluding working capital to exceed $3 billion, assuming an average Brent
price of $65 a barrel. We're committed to lowering the carbon intensity of our Permian operations. One recent
example is our shift from diesel fuel to electricity and natural gas to power drilling rigs and completion spreads.
This reduces emissions, reduces well costs, and takes trucks off the roads, which results in higher returns and
lower carbon.
At FGP-WPMP, overall progress is at 84% with field construction 69% complete. We've recently reviewed our
cost and schedule targets. At this point, the net schedule extension from the pandemic is expected to be roughly
a quarter for WPMP and two quarters for FGP. Our cost target remains $45.2 billion as cost reduction efforts and
favorable exchange rates offset an estimated $1.9 billion of incremental costs associated with COVID.
The COVID costs include mitigation efforts, demob and remobilization costs, as well as the expected schedule
extension I just mentioned. Although the total project cost target is unchanged, we have increased the project
contingency to $1.9 billion to recognize the schedule uncertainty associated with the virus and its variants. The
project is currently at peak workforce and our primary focus is to mitigate the impact of the virus with vaccinations,
testing, and isolation protocols to enable our workforce to achieve its productivity.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Ballymore project is being developed as a subsea tie back to our existing
Blind Faith facility. The project recently entered frontend engineering and design and remains on track for a final
investment decision next year.
Earlier this month, we sanctioned the Whale project which has the potential for future expansion. Fabrication of
the Anchor project remains on track with assembly of the production facility hull underway.
In Australia, we've sanctioned the Jansz-Io compression project, which will support the flow of natural gas to
Barrow Island. Repairs to the Gorgon propane heat exchangers are complete and we now have all five operated
LNG trains online in Australia.
In Colorado, our newest generation of production facilities have eliminated the tanks and flare system to deliver a
carbon intensity of only 6 kilograms of CO2 per BOE. The new facilities also have a 60% smaller footprint, higher
reliability, and 15% to 20% lower lifecycle costs than a traditional facility design, another great example of higher
returns and lower carbon.
Back to you, Pierre.

Thanks, Jay. In May, we closed the acquisition of Noble Midstream. With this transaction complete, we have fully
integrated Noble and have achieved greater than $600 million in synergies three months earlier than previously
guided. We also started up a mixed feed cracker at GS Caltex, and plan to be at 100% of design capacity in the
third quarter. The project was completed under budget and five months ahead of schedule.
In the third quarter, we're resuming our share repurchase program at a targeted annual rate of $2 billion to $3
billion. This is a rate that we believe is sustainable through the cycle while continuing to pay down debt.
The restart of our program is consistent with our financial priorities and builds on our track record. We have a
history of buying back shares consistently, in meaningful quantities and at a price close to the daily ratable
average over the entire 17-year period.
We're continuing to grow lower-carbon businesses. This quarter, we started co-processing bio-feedstock at our El
Segundo refinery, growing renewable diesel production in a capital efficient manner by leveraging existing
infrastructure.
We recently announced an MOU with Cummins to develop commercially viable businesses in hydrogen. Also,
we've completed front-end engineering on a carbon capture project for emissions from the gas turbines in one of
our California co-generation facilities. This project leverages two innovative technologies, CO2 concentration and
carbon capture, and has the potential to scale across our full fleet of turbines.
Finally, yesterday we announced the creation of Chevron New Energies, a new organization reporting directly to
the CEO. This is an important step to build fast-growing, profitable new energy businesses to further advance a
lower carbon future.
Now, looking ahead. In the third quarter, we expect major turnarounds to reduce upstream production by 150,000
barrels of oil-equivalent per day, primarily at TCO which also reduces our expected curtailments to about 5,000
barrels per day. We expect to make an incremental pension contribution in the third quarter of $500 million. This
is a one-time payment in addition to our regular quarterly contributions.
With higher operating cash flows, TCO expects to pay back part of its loans this year versus our prior guidance of
increasing its debt. There's no change in TCO's expected dividend this year. We've adjusted the guidance on the
affiliate income line to reflect higher expected TCO earnings. Also, we expect higher dividends from CPChem, in
line with our share of higher earnings.
On September 14, we'll be hosting our Energy Transition Spotlight to provide more details on how we plan to
lower carbon intensity in our operations and grow lower carbon businesses. We invite you all to join us for this
video webcast.
Our objective is unchanged. Higher returns, lower carbon. During this quarter, we continued to make progress
towards this goal, delivering stronger financial results and achieving important lower carbon milestones, and with
oil prices well-above our dividend breakeven, and an industry-leading balance sheet, we will resume share
buybacks, sharing part of the cash upside with our investors.
With that, I'll turn it back to Roderick.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Hey, good morning. Pierre, I want to pick up where you left off there on capital allocation. You announced a $2
billion to $3 billion buyback, which adds about $5 a barrel to your breakeven, which I think is about $50 inclusive
of the dividend. So obviously you want to have a sustainable plan. You've always talked about that. Oil is at $75
now, so I guess help us put this in context. I mean, we have $15, $20 a barrel of extra oil price at this point, and
your leverage is at 21% net debt-to-cap, so you want to keep driving down debt from here, or how are you
thinking about things?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks, Phil. By resuming the program, we'll now be 14 of the last 18 years that we have repurchased shares, so
that's more than three out of every four years. And we're doing it at a level that allows us to continue to pay down
debt. As you say with prices above $70, our debt levels should head below the range that I've talked about of 20%
to 25%. That 20% to 25% net debt ratio range is really over the cycle, kind of implies prices between $40 and $60
like we talked about during our Investor Day. But again, with prices well above that, we should head below the
bottom of that range.
In terms of the breakeven, I mean, this is our fourth priority from a financial perspective, and so it is, we feel it's
sustainable. We intend to sustain it over the cycle, but I don't necessarily view it as a commitment like we would
say our dividend is and bake it into the breakeven calculation. But the last thing I'll say is that at our Investor Day
we showed that at $60 flat Brent nominal over five years, we can generate more than $25 billion of excess cash.
That's cash in excess of our capital and our dividend, and so you see us starting this buyback program at $2
billion to $3 billion a year. It shows that we have more than enough capacity to sustain that at reasonable prices.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Phil Gresh
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then the second question just on the CapEx side of things, the $1 billion
reduction you said was a combination of Tengiz timing and efficiencies. Is there any further breakdown you could
give of those two factors? I'm trying to think about how some of this might carry forward as we look at the longerterm $14 billion to $16 billion range you've talked about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, let me start, then I'll pass it over to Jay. So, we lowered our guidance for this year only to $13 billion. As
you say, it's primarily due to lower spend at TCO, in part from work that's being deferred, and then greater capital
efficiencies across the portfolio. I think you can view that as about 50/50. It's a half project that's being deferred
and half greater capital efficiency. There's no change in our long-term guidance, our guidance through 2025 of
$14 billion to $16 billion. But Jay, maybe you could talk about some of the ways we're being more capital efficient.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

Yeah, it's really across the portfolio, as Pierre said, but in particular, drilling and completion activities. The Gorgon
Stage 2 project in Australia has been very efficient and gone ahead of plan from a cost standpoint. The Permian
drilling and completion and other US shale and tight has been very efficient. And then we're seeing just overall
good discipline on costs, making sure every dollar count and it's really consistent with operating in not only this
COVID environment but operating with a very disciplined mentality throughout the organization.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey
Analyst, Sankey Research LLC

Q

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just to follow-up, if I could, you guys obviously have the mega project at Tengiz as
an ongoing development, but the history of these mega projects has been somewhat troubled by very high costs
and CapEx. Is Tengiz going to be the last mega project do you think, and beyond that, would be really be looking
at the Permian as sort of a fragmented but mega development? Is that what we're looking at, and is that how your
CapEx guidance that you just repeated, is that sort of how that's set up that we won't see another mega project
developed by you or perhaps by any major western oil? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks, Paul. You know, in the oil industry, you never say never, but look, we've talked before that as we move
forward with the asset and the portfolio that we have, the preponderance of our capital, 60% and more is going to
be going into shorter-cycle, high-return projects, which are very quick to bring new production on. We have low
pre-productive capital. They tend to be very efficient and we can adjust based on market conditions and react
quite rapidly.

But that doesn't mean all of our investment will always be in just short-cycle. The deepwater continues to be an
important part of our portfolio. It has very low carbon footprint, and it tends to have high returns. And so we've
seen projects like Anchor and Whale and Ballymore in the queue, and we'll continue to see those roll in but we're
going to do that in a very disciplined way.
We talked at the Investor Day about how we are taking action to make these capital projects more efficient, more
effective, going to the minimum facility objectives and really building only what's necessary to deliver the returns
that we're looking for. And I think that whole approach as well as it being a relatively small amount of our capital is
going to lead to much more efficient and higher-return outcomes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul Sankey

Q

Analyst, Sankey Research LLC

Thank you very much, Jay. And then the follow-up would be, Pierre, how did you come up with the $2 billion to $3
billion of buyback annually? Can you just talk about the parameters, maybe the oil price assumption? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Well, we're thinking of a range of oil prices. I've said in the past, Paul, as you know, that we would start a program
when we were confident we could sustain it over the cycle, through multiple years based on our confidence in
excess cash flow and the strength of the balance sheet. And so you certainly can assume that both of those
criteria have been met.
In terms of the level, it is to continue to pay down debt while we're having these prices, so it's nothing really more
than that. Again, as I said earlier to Phil's question, with prices above $70, our net debt ratio should be below
20%. And so this is a range that allows us to continue to do that. This also gives us a range to deal with
uncertainty. We feel good about the macro, but undoubtedly, there's a variance out there that can impact demand
and you have OPEC+ still having curtailed volume, so that flexibility is inherent in the range.
It also gives us flexibility to buy more or less depending on the strength of Chevron stock price, which we've heard
from shareholders who have said they want us to try to beat the daily average. I showed a chart that says we
don't buy high. We buy very close to the daily average, but if we can do a bit better and use some discretion,
we've heard from our shareholders that they'd prefer that. So that's the thinking that goes behind the level, the
range, and the timing.

Doug Leggate
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.

Q

Oh, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Jay, I wonder if I could go to you first, it's maybe a small follow-up to
Paul's question. It seems to us that there's a lot going on in the Gulf of Mexico that's kind of flying under the radar.
You mentioned Ballymore, Whale, and Anchor. You've got Leopard, you've got non-working interest in Leopard
and Puma and a few other things going on, and this obviously has been a legacy infrastructure area for you guys,
very efficient capital tie back opportunities and so on. I just wonder if I could ask you just to give us a quick update
as to what your activity level is there and what your longer-term plans are, because it seems there's a lot more
going on than perhaps you'd laid out to the Street at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

Well, Doug, the Gulf of Mexico has been an important part of our portfolio for a long time and it continues to be.
We're one of the largest leaseholders in the Gulf of Mexico, but importantly, what we've been doing is focusing
our new lease acquisitions to primarily concentrate in those areas where we already have infrastructure. And as
we've talked before, with our focus on returns, we're looking for those opportunities where we can do exploration
and if we find something that's normal, it can be tied back into our existing infrastructure much like a Ballymore. If
we find something that ends up really big and justifies a greenfield development, we can go the route of a Whale
project, where we continue to focus on the minimum functional objectives, building facilities that are replicative in
nature so that we are building on the learnings of the past.
We've developed the deepwater asset class, so we're taking learnings from the Gulf of Mexico, from West Africa,
from deepwater Australia, sharing those rapidly between these different asset groups to make sure that we're
staying on the forefront of efficiency. So we have an exploration program that's laid out. We keep that at a pretty
low level these days so that it can be very efficient, very focused. We have a good resource base across the
portfolio, but we're always looking for that next high-return, low carbon barrel. And the Gulf of Mexico represents a
good hunting ground for that.

Sorry, Jay, I don't mean to press you, but I mentioned a couple Leopard, Puma, and I think you've got Silverback
as well. Can you give us an update on those?

Doug Leggate
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.

Q

Okay. Thanks. Pierre, my quick follow-up is plenty of cash flow coming in, extraordinary capital efficiency. As Paul
pointed out, not a huge amount of big projects in front of you. What are you thinking currently on M&A because
clearly you did a fantastic job incorporating Noble? What's your latest thinking in terms of where that might fit and
use of cash flow going forward, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, we're very happy with Noble. As we just said, we sort of declared the integration complete, more than
double the initial synergies, completed NBLX. We're the first to announce, first to close quality assets, low
premium and done at a good time from an exchange ratio perspective. As you know, we're always looking. We
have a very high bar, and we certainly don't need to do a transaction. We just talked about our portfolio and how
we can sustain and grow it in a very capital efficient way.
Just the last thing I would say is and we've shown this that we don't really view cash as being something that's
required to do M&A. In our business, with oil prices volatility doing it on a stock basis, as we did it with Noble,
makes a lot of sense. It kind of keeps you hedged in case prices go up or down between a buyer and seller. So I
wouldn't connect any kind of balance sheet actions as being an indicator one way or the other on M&A. We're
going to be disciplined with our capital. It's all capital whether it's organic or inorganic, and of course, we'll only
take action if we see it in the interest of our shareholders.

Neil Mehta
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Hey, thank you. Jay, the first question's for you on Tengiz. Appreciate the update here. Can you just go through
some of the modeling work that you've done to get to that $2 billion of contingency and give investors your latest
read and confidence interval around the cost? It did seem like a good update relative to what was feared, and the
summer's always so important in Kazakhstan. Just talk about the key things that you're going to be watching for
over the next couple of months to ensure that you're on track.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks, Neil. I'd be happy to. At TCO, the team's just done an extraordinary job of responding to the impact of the
virus. And as we said, we've been able to capture cost savings, which have largely offset along with some of our
foreign-exchange gains, offset the incremental costs due to COVID. So at this point in time, we've reached our
peak workforce on FGP, and so we are maintaining that workforce. It is something where we have to continue to
stay focused on mitigations, particularly with the rise in the Delta variant and other variants that we are exposed
to.
The vaccination program continues to go well. We have 42,000 members of our workforce that have gotten their
initial dose, and about 30,000 that are fully vaccinated now, and we continue to try and work with the Kazakh
government to increase those numbers.
Because we were so successful in completing the fabrication and that fabrication was done with such high-quality
and it's been proven to be now dimensionally accurate, we've had our modules showing up at-site within 1 to 3millimeters of accuracy on where pipes land and the connections between modules. It's really helped us move
forward from that standpoint. All of the modules going through the shipping program to arrive at Tengiz, they've all
been successfully moved to site, restacked, and set on their foundations, so we have that entire program behind
us now.
All the heavy equipment for the project has been set on foundations throughout the project so our heavy lift
program is complete and B&D mobilized and now we're just focused on the interconnections and the hook-up and
preparing for the turnover to completions and start-up.
So normally at this point we would be decreasing our contingency because we have eliminated so many of the
traditional risks, but in this case we've actually increased it to $1.9 billion and that's primarily due to our
uncertainty around future impacts from COVID. This pandemic is far from over around the world and so while
we're doing well and we've been very successful at mitigating any potential impact to this, as you said, critically important summer, we need to stay that way.
We're monitoring our productivity. We are very focused on being capitally efficient here. Our focus is on delivering
this project at $45.2 billion. We've allowed the schedule to slip a little bit because it's just too hard to try and catchup. We didn't feel that was a good use of resource so our predominant focus is on the costs and we're managing
the schedule within that cost parameter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil Mehta

Q

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Thanks, Jay. Following up here on the asset level, can you talk about how you see the cadence of activity in the
Permian? You talked about exiting the year close to 600,000 barrels a day. Remind us where you are right now.
And do you see the Permian still as a growth engine for you or are you planning on running the business more for
free cash flow and with less growth in mind as we think about 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

In the Permian, we currently, as you know, we scaled back activity significantly last year, and we've maintained a
lower level of activity, but at the same time, even with a constant level of activity, because the efficiency is getting
better, we're actually getting more output from those reduced levels. We did add an additional completion crew in
July and we expect to add another one before year end. We currently have five drilling rigs out there and we
expect to add at least one or two more in late third quarter and fourth quarter. So we are seeing our activity level
start to increase in the second-half as we see markets not in balance but are starting to move in the right direction
towards approaching the equilibrium.
We'll continue to monitor where we are in terms of the overall market signals that come to us, but we're going to
continue to be very disciplined and focused. Our returns remain the number one objective. We are going to stay
disciplined around those returns, but we are moving back into more and more efficient factory drilling again as
opposed to having to be focused on lease retention as we were over the last 18 months or so. So I think the
Permian is going to continue to be a critical asset in our portfolio. What we've generated and demonstrated is that
we can generate free cash flow while we continue to grow and that's because we maintain that disciplined focus
on the balance as we look forward.

Q

Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.

Two questions. In Permian, Jay, when you're looking at what you're going to do in the next year or the next couple
years, whether that the OPEC current curtailment means that whether the market is still fundamentally long
supply or not does it play into your decision-making process?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson

A

Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

Well, I think of course, it does, and that's because we're not just being triggered by an instantaneous price or
some price threshold to signal a need for more activity. As we've talked about, as we gave you guidance at the
Investor Day, we've given you our forward look of the Permian, with the expectations of how markets recover.
Now we've seen demand recover in the marketplace quite rapidly, and in most of the products other than maybe
international jet fuel, we're seeing demand starting to return to pre-pandemic levels.
But the supply picture, it's still a fundamentally oversupplied world, and that's why we're being cautious, we're
being balanced, and we're going to continue to monitor the market as we continue to decide how to ramp up our
activity levels in the Permian. The Permian has very low carbon intensity, so it's a good place for us to continue to
develop new barrels, not only for us but for the world, but it also has high returns for us, so it remains a key target
for increased capital allocation. But we're not going to be driven by an output target or a production target. We're
driven by the opportunity to make returns.

Okay. The second question, actually, this is for Pierre. In the next several years when you're looking at $14 billion
to $16 billion a year in CapEx, do you have a target percentage on how much you're going to spend in the new
ESG initiative in the business?

Pierre R. Breber

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Paul, yeah. We talked at our Investor Day about $3 billion in total to lower the carbon intensity of our operations
and grow low-carbon businesses. That was through 2028. And in terms of updates to that, I'll wait and put another
advertisement for our Energy Transition Spotlight. So that'll be September 14. That'll be webcast for everybody.
We will go deeper into our actions to advance a lower carbon future and we'll have more to say then.

Hey, guys. You and your partner recently FID Whale. Can you help us with some more details, CapEx, volumes,
anything which will help us model the project a little better so you get credit for it in the estimates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, thanks for the question. What I would say is we're not the operator and so for those types of questions we
like to refer you to the operator as the best source of information for those types of things. I will say Whale is a
really good asset. We're happy to invest in this project. We expect low carbon intensity from the production from
this asset. We're looking for good returns. It's also based on many of the principles that we have been talking
about for better capital efficiency.
It's based on a minimum facility objective where this facility is largely a replica of a previous Gulf of Mexico
development. There was great cooperation between Chevron and the operator to develop just what was the right
balance between using exactly what was done before and what enhancements or innovation needed to be
incorporated into the facility. So we're quite happy with this project and look forward to seeing it progress. But I'll
refer you to the operator for the details.

Q

My quick follow-up here is CPChem mostly was very strong in the quarter. My question is at one point, you and
Qatar Petroleum were actually looking to build two JV crackers and then obviously the pandemic happened, and
so how should we think about those crackers? Is there a possibility they can be brought back on the table, given
the tightness you're seeing in ethylene chain margins, or should we think about them as projects which might not
be pursued ever?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

We're continuing to advance those projects, and when I say we, I mean our joint venture Chevron Phillips
Chemical Company in partnership with the Qataris, as you said. So I'd say the Gulf Coast project is a bit ahead.
FEED was completed late last year, and then we're working together on determining next steps, including when a
final investment decision will occur, and we continue to advance the project in Ras Laffan.
They both are very competitive projects that work off of low-cost feedstock, ethane feedstock so they're
advantaged, we think, relative to others around the world. At the same time, Manav, you know it is tight right now
with strong demand, tight inventories and some of the carry-on effects from Winter Storm Uri, but we are seeing
capacity additions coming on in the medium term. And so Mark Nelson, our Head of Downstream, and his team
are focused on having very capital efficient projects. So it's not enough to just have the ethane feed advantage
but it's having a really capital and cost efficient development and that's what the teams are working on.

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first one is on Agbami. One of your peers highlighted a redetermination of
the Agbami field in Nigeria, and you're a majority owner. There's actually limited details on this outside of the

Pierre R. Breber

A

We are not. We've talked in the past about isolated areas, for example, steel costs that go into our tubulars and
our wells is up, but it's a fairly, it's a small component of a well cost, maybe about 10%. We certainly are seeing
tightness in trucking services that has impacted us at times and some wage labor cost increases there, but I think
there's more talk about it than we're seeing in terms of action. I'd say our COGS is pretty well under control in the
upstream and downstream segments.

Stephen Richardson
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC

Q

Hi. Good morning. Pierre, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about in terms of the New Energies
business. Curious as you go further down this road and build-out this business plan, as you're seeing – there just
seems to be a consistent theme here which is policy frameworks and different geographies and are they
conducive to actually building a business. And so curious, your perspective on finding enough high-return
businesses that have the right market and policy framework today versus some of the things that you might have
to wait on and just in the context of making sure you don't tie up some capital and some things that have some
externality, so just curious on that point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Well, we operate in California, which has a lot of policy support in this area and we're the leading downstream
player here with the leading brand, and have a large upstream business. But you're right, policy does vary but
there's enough policy to advance these businesses.
Now, there are two main parts to our lower-carbon activities. The first is to lower the carbon intensity of our
operations and that largely does not inherent on policy, or at least certainly the first steps. We put out a 2028
target that has a 35% reduction to 24 kilograms per barrel, and that's something we're taking action on. And then
we're also advancing lower-carbon businesses. The announcement yesterday was really focused on hydrogen
carbon capture. Our downstream team is advancing renewable fuels. We've talked about renewable natural gas
and renewable diesel previously.
What we're trying to do around lower-carbon really is connected to our assets capabilities and customers. So one
thing we're not doing in lower-carbon is large-scale wind and solar. We're certainly having renewable power
supplier operations, again part of lowering the carbon intensity, but not pursuing it as a stand-alone business.
That's a decision that we're making because we don't feel like we have the competitive advantage. But when we
get to renewable fuels like renewable natural gas, renewable diesel, sustainable jet, hydrogen carbon capture,
these are areas that are adjacent to our business, where again, we have capability, we have customers, and we
have assets that we can leverage.

We sell to United Airlines. United Airlines is going to buy a sustainable jet, sustainable jet is going to be a
percentage of jet for some time period, 2%, 5%, 10% mixed with conventional. We're the natural player in that
space, so again, we'll share more on September 14, but that's a little taste of what you should expect from us.

Jon Rigby

Q

Thank you very much. I think this a question for Jay. You've referenced a couple times carbon intensity around
projects, and I think the operator on Whale highlighted it in the FID statement. I just wonder whether you could
talk a little about that. I was struck actually by the comments also you made in the prepared remarks around the
Colorado, very, very low carbon emissions by BOE, so a few things. One is can you talk about how you feature
carbon emission profiles into your FID process alongside traditional NPVs, IRRs, payback periods, et cetera?
And secondly, whether as you look at your portfolio as it stands right now, which obviously being built-up over
years and decades, whether there's works that can be done around it at both source or lower-carbon emissions
and actually as, I think, Pierre referenced if you're adding renewables as a sort of power source whether you can
actually also make an economic return as well in conjunction with that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks for the question. It's pretty broad question, so I'm going to start broad, but then I'll focus in on the Gulf of
Mexico. In the upstream portfolio, as we take stock of where we are as Chevron, our entire upstream portfolio, as
best we can determine sits at roughly half of the industry average for carbon intensity worldwide, so we're starting
from a good position.
We've been very focused on starting to bring our carbon down for some time now, and so we set our initial goals
back in 2016 for carbon intensity reduction for the upstream. Since 2016, we've actually reduced our flaring by
60% and our methane emissions by 50%, and we've done that largely through what we call the marginal
abatement cost curves.
And just as we do in exploration, we don't have every business unit out there making their own independent
decisions, but rather, they bring their ideas for carbon reduction investments to the center, and then we look
across the entire enterprise, not just upstream but upstream and downstream, midstream, and we invest into
those opportunities that give us the greatest carbon reduction for the least amount of capital. And that's in keeping
with our focus on being a higher-return company.
What we've been able to find so far is that the projects have been relatively low hanging fruit. And so we've seen
these big reductions in carbon that's occurred since 2016. And in fact, we reached our 2013 targets – sorry, 2023
targets in 2020, three years ahead of schedule. And so we've already set new targets which we talked to you
about at the Investor Day in March, for 2028, and that's the path that we're working towards now, and that's to get
down to an average of 24 kilograms of CO2 per barrel equivalent across the entire portfolio.
Places like the DJ Basin where some of the Noble teams have done a great job of designing out the parts of the
process that have the highest emissions have resulted in those huge gains. And so as we said, not only are we
seeing a 15% to 20% lower lifecycle cost, we're seeing high reliability, a 60% footprint reduction, and they're down
in the 6-kilogram per CO2 per barrel equivalent range, which is tremendous.
To put that into comparison, the entire Gulf of Mexico, our operations last year in 2020 were at 7 kilograms per
CO2, and that's why we think it's so important. There's good information for policymakers to understand that
places like the Gulf of Mexico allow us to produce a very critical supply of energy to the United States and to the
world, but also do that in a very carbon efficient manner. So in terms of our decision-making, these are all
elements that we have to balance as we make investment decisions, but we are bringing these factors and these
criteria into the equation as we evaluate where we're going to allocate capital and how we're going to move
forward.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Gabelman
Analyst, Cowen and Company, LLC

Q

Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. First, on the buyback. If I recall correctly last year, there was concern
around what OPEC+ would do and that factored into both your shareholder distribution strategy as well as your
Permian production strategy. Are you kind of confident now that OPEC+ is going to continue to manage the
market, and does that factor into your strategy or your decision to resume buybacks, or were those kind of looked
at independently?
And then secondly, just a clarification on TCO FGP. Can you remind us what the free cash flow flip is from I guess
2022 which is the last full year of project spend to 2024 when the project is fully up and running? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Thanks, Jason. I'll start with the second one. We haven't given asset level free cash flow guidance for TCO.
You're absolutely right that you will see increased dividends from Tengiz from our ownership interest in TCO, both
as capital rolls off and as the project starts up. It's a big part of the company's guidance of 10% annual free cash
flow for between now and 2025. A lot of that comes from the Permian. A lot of it comes from Tengiz. And as you
also know, we'll get the loans repaid back. That shows up in a different part of the cash flow statement, but its still
cash. So there's nothing asset-specific that we've shared, but it's included in our overall free cash flow guidance
that I'll refer you to our Investor Day and perhaps as we get closer to the start-up, we can share that in a more
specific way for you all.
In terms of the share buyback, again, we look at those criteria. Are we comfortable we can sustain it, confident we
can sustain it over the cycle? There are uncertainties. I cited the Delta variant as an uncertainty and OPEC+. So if
OPEC+ are going to take the actions that are in their interest, we don't have any greater insight into that. It is an
uncertainty, but we have enough confidence in all the investments and assets that Jay has been talking about, the
strong downstream and chemicals performance that we've seen, the economic recovery that we've seen, the
discipline on the supply side that we've seen from companies in this country, and really around the world, that we
feel good that we can keep this program in place for multiple years and also pay down debt while we're doing it.
Thanks, Jason.

Ryan M. Todd
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.

Q

Thanks. Maybe a quick follow-up on some of the balance sheet conversation from earlier. I know, Pierre, you said
that this is one of those times that with the oil price where it is you're likely to trend below the 20% to 25% net debt
target. But is there a floor on the debt level in terms of the balance sheet that where you start to feel like you're
under-levered at some point either from a absolute debt level point of view, from a debt-to-cap point of view, or
even from like an efficient retirement of debt point of view that would start to skew excess cash more towards
buyback or dividend growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber
Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, there is. I won't cite a number and it's because we don't have one internally. I mean, there's no hard and fast
number, but undoubtedly, with the flexibility of our capital program, with the cash flow generation, I mean the
reason why that I've cited that 20% to 25% range, which is arguably higher maybe than we would have had five
years ago when we had a lot of long-dated capital projects and we would have wanted and had in fact the debt
level quite a bit lower, because we had long-dated commitments.
We are, as we talked about earlier, getting to the near the end or a couple years away from Tengiz being
completed. The vast majority of our capital program is much more flexible, so that gives us this higher range. So
I'd like to get comfortably below it. If you're asking the question, would we increase the share buyback, yeah,
that's absolutely possible. If we get our debt ratio comfortably below the 20%, and then we look out again in terms
of our cash flows, we can increase the range. We showed the history of our share buybacks. We haven't kept it at
the rate that we've started it at. We've increased it at times, we've decreased it. And so you'd expect us to
continue to do the same thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan M. Todd

Q

Great. Thanks. And maybe a separate follow-up on energy transition activities. You continue to be fairly active in
renewable natural gas. You've done a modest amount. I know you mentioned some co-processing seen in the
renewable diesel or maybe we just don't have a lot of detail on it yet, but how are you thinking about the
opportunity set as you look down the line for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel? I mean would you
consider doing something more meaningful including the potential conversion of an asset or likely focus on
smaller steps like co-processing?

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Well again, we'll share more at the Spotlight. The co-processing that we just started is it's a two-stage process, so
we'll be up to have a capacity of up to 10,000 barrels a day by year end, so we kind of brought on the first phase
with another phase. We'll be the first US refinery to co-process through an FCC in the second phase and again
that'll give us the capability to produce up to 10,000 barrels a day.
We did it this way in part because it's very capital efficient. We are leveraging existing kit. It's literally just a tank
and some pipes, and so we can do this in a very capital efficient way. There's undoubtedly a growth in renewable
diesel on the demand side, but there's also growth on the supply side. Renewable markets work in commodity
markets just like the conventional products do, and so we're going to continue to be disciplined in how we
approach it. And so this is a very competitive project, and I think you'll see more from us again when we talk about
it on the Spotlight on September 14.

Q

Thanks. How are you? Just one for me on LNG as an asset class in the context of low carbon. I'm pretty sure it
would be below your target on a per-unit basis, but look, gas prices are very high globally, LNG prices are very
high. There's some opportunities out there in LNG, and I'm just wondering on sort of Chevron's official position on
how that marries with your broader emissions targets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President-Upstream, Chevron Corp.

A

Well, this is certainly a part of when we look at our portfolio, we consider the LNG assets and production to be
part of the upstream, so that's in all of the numbers that we've given you. And we continue to look for
opportunities to make those operations more efficient and lower our carbon intensity. We think natural gas is an
important fuel. It's an important transition fuel. It's going to play a critical role as the world continues to lower its
overall carbon footprint, and so we are going to stay focused on incrementally creeping capacity of our existing
facilities.
We'll look at the opportunities to use existing ullage or upcoming ullage in other facilities to increase our
production through those facilities, but most importantly, we want to leverage the investments that we've already
made to continue to focus on higher returns as we go forward. So it's a part of the portfolio, but doesn't occupy
any particular premium or special place.

Good morning, all. My one question is just really on protection. You guys in the past used interest rate swaps and
other factors. Just wonder there's a lot of discussion these days about hedges in oil. I'm just wondering, obviously,
you've got a fantastic balance sheet but nobody worries on that side, but just wondering kind of your policy and
strategies how you think about various protection, as I mentioned interest rate swaps, hedges, sort of all of the
above. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Pierre R. Breber

A

Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Chevron Corp.

Well, on the commodity price side, we don't hedge, except for transportation but we don't have flat priced
commodity hedges. And in terms of our debt, I mean, we tend to have a fair amount of variable debt or short-term
debt, commercial paper and others, but undoubtedly we also have some term debt that's at fixed. So I think our
average interest cost is around 2%. Our mix is probably less than half variable, but as you say, we are a very
strong credit, very strong balance sheet, and so we don't pay for a lot for insurance and we don't think our
shareholders want that. I think our shareholders want certainly exposure to commodity prices so they enjoy the
upside and then they want us to maintain a strong balance sheet. Thanks, Neil.
